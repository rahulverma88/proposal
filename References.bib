The force due to a bridge of capillary condensate can be calculated from macroscopic thermodynamics, but the bridges are often so small that macroscopic thermodynamics may not be applicable.

	abstract = {The flow of two immiscible fluids through a porous medium depends on the complex interplay between gravity, capillarity, and viscous forces. The interaction between these forces and the geometry of the medium gives rise to a variety of complex flow regimes that are difficult to describe using continuum models. Although a number of pore-scale models have been employed, a careful investigation of the macroscopic effects of pore-scale processes requires methods based on conservation principles in order to reduce the number of modeling assumptions. In this work we perform direct numerical simulations of drainage by solving Navier–Stokes equations in the pore space and employing the Volume Of Fluid (VOF) method to track the evolution of the fluid–fluid interface. After demonstrating that the method is able to deal with large viscosity contrasts and model the transition from stable flow to viscous fingering, we focus on the macroscopic capillary pressure and we compare different definitions of this quantity under quasi-static and dynamic conditions. We show that the difference between the intrinsic phase-average pressures, which is commonly used as definition of Darcy-scale capillary pressure, is subject to several limitations and it is not accurate in presence of viscous effects or trapping. In contrast, a definition based on the variation of the total surface energy provides an accurate estimate of the macroscopic capillary pressure. This definition, which links the capillary pressure to its physical origin, allows a better separation of viscous effects and does not depend on the presence of trapped fluid clusters.},

Qualitative arguments suggest that the nontraditional terms may be important whenμ β /μ γ is of order one, and order of magnitude analysis indicates that they may be significant in terms of the motion of a fluid at very low volume fractions.

	abstract = {In the subsurface, fluids play a critical role by transporting dissolved minerals, colloids, and contaminants (sometimes over long distances); by mediating dissolution and precipitation processes; and by enabling chemical transformations in solution and at mineral surfaces. Although the complex geometries of fracture apertures, fracture networks, and pore spaces may make it difficult to accurately predict fluid flow in saturated (single-phase) subsurface systems, well-developed methods are available. The simulation of multiphase fluid flow in the subsurface is much more challenging because of the large density and/or viscosity ratios found in important applications (water/air in the vadose zone; water/oil, water/gas, gas/oil, and water/oil/gas in hydrocarbon reservoirs; water/air/nonaqueous phase liquids (nonaqueous phase liquids/dense nonaqueous phase liquids) in contaminated vadose zone systems; and gas/molten rock in volcanic systems, for example). In addition, the complex behavior of fluid-fluid-solid contact lines and their impact on dynamic contact angles must also be taken into account and coupled with the fluid flow. Here we review the methods that are currently being used to simulate pore-scale multiphase fluid flow and reactive transport in fractured and porous media. After the introduction, the review begins with an overview of the fundamental physics of multiphase fluids flow followed by a more detailed discussion of the complex dynamic behavior of contact lines and contact angles, an important barrier to accurate pore-scale modeling and simulation. The main part of the review focuses on five different approaches: pore network models, lattice gas and lattice Boltzmann methods, Monte Carlo methods, particle methods (molecular dynamics, dissipative particle dynamics, and smoothed particle hydrodynamics), and traditional grid-based computational fluid dynamics coupled with interface tracking and a contact angle model. Finally, the review closes with a discussion of future trends and challenges.},

A flat fluid interface moving steadily over a flat solid is modeled with the creeping flow approximation, which turns out to be self-consistent. Adherence is required except at the contact line itself. Though the velocity field appears to be realistic, stresses and viscous dissipation are found to increase without bound at the contact line. The way the hydrodynamic model breaks down suggests that in reality there may be steep gradients, rheological anomalies, and discontinuous processes around the contact line.

	abstract = {The effective specific air-water interfacial area (a¯i) in a sand-packed column was measured at several water saturations (Sw) using a surface-reactive tracer (sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (SDBS)) and a nonreactive tracer (bromide). Miscible displacement experiments were conducted under steady water flow conditions to quantify the retardation of SDBS resulting from its adsorption onto the air-water interface in a sand-packed column. A consistent trend of increased retardation of SDBS compared with the nonreactive tracer, bromide, was observed with decreasing Sw. The data for air-water surface tension measured at various SDBS concentrations were interpreted using the Gibbs model to estimate the required adsorption parameters. The retardation factors (Rt) for SDBS breakthrough curves were then used in combination with the estimated SDBS adsorption coefficient to calculate the a¯i values at different Sw. For the range of experimental conditions employed in this study, the retardation factor for SDBS ranged from Rt = 1.00 at Sw = 1.00 (Rt {\textbackslash}textless 1 due to SDBS sorption on sand) to Rt = 3.44 at Sw = 0.29 (which corresponds to a¯i = 46 cm2/c/m3 ). These values are in agreement with theoretical predictions and recently published data. Improvements needed to overcome the experimental limitations of the presented method are also discussed.},

	abstract = {We describe the development and application of a three-dimensional pore-scale network simulator for modeling capillary-dominated three-phase flow in porous media where the wettability varies from pore to pore, i.e., where each pore is allowed to have a different oil-water contact angle from a chosen distribution. Physical constraint equations for the remaining gas-oil and gas-water contact angles are implemented. In weakly wetted pores wetting films are absent, which reduces the continuity of the various phases in the network and increases the number of phase clusters that are disconnected from inlet or outlet. Mobilization of disconnected clusters requires incorporation of double and multiple displacement chains that involve a string of neighboring phase clusters, e.g., gas→oil→gas→oil→water. Furthermore, when multiple displacement chains cause disconnected clusters to reconnect to the outlet, the phase pressures at the outlet boundary are updated consistent with the pressures within the system. A number of benchmark simulations for systems with nonuniform wettability, mixed-wet with the larger pores oil-wet, are presented. The outcome of these simulations is presented as phase paths in saturation space and in the form of pore occupancy histograms and histograms of the length and type of displacement chains. Comparison of simulated saturation paths with those of an analytical capillary bundle model with the same wettability show good agreement where phase continuity is high and decreasing agreement as phase continuity in the network decreases. The saturation paths and occupancy and displacement statistics for a number of water-alternating-gas injection (WAG) simulations bring out the various features of the model, in particular, those related to the wettability. We find that multiple displacements do occur, mainly during higher-order WAG floods, although their effect on oil recovery seems limited. Variation of the outlet boundary pressure differences has an effect in certain regions of the saturation space that are defined by the analytical model.},

These equations describe a wide range of wave propagation and transport phenomena arising in nearly every scientific and engineering discipline. Several applications are described in a self-contained manner, along with much of the mathematical theory of hyperbolic problems. High-resolution versions of Godunov's method are developed, in which Riemann problems are solved to determine the local wave structure and limiters are applied to eliminate numerical oscillations. The methods were orginally designed to capture shock waves accurately, but are also useful tools for studying linear wave-progagation problems, particulary in heterogenous material. The methods studied are in the CLAWPACK software package. Source code for all the examples presented can be found on the web, along with animations of many of the simulations. This provides an excellent learning environment for understanding wave propagation phenomena and finite volume methods.},

	abstract = {In order to obtain consistency with the force balance theory of Young and Laplace, which quantitatively predicts the height of capillary rise from the contact angles of drops on solid surfaces, Gibbs made chemical potentials in interface functions of the integral interface free energies. We cite evidence that equilibrium chemical potentials in one-component systems are identical at interfaces to equilibrium chemical potentials in bulk phases. We evaluate two postulates. (1) Partial free energies of liquids at an interface with a solid are functions of the strength and range of attractive fields outside solid phase boundaries. (2) At equilibrium, the chemical potentials in all interfaces of a one-component liquid equal the chemical potential in its interior when the liquid is bonded to one or more immiscible solids. These postulates yield equations for partial equilibrium (PE) states of drops, films, and liquids. The PE equations yield the same prediction of the height of a meniscus from the contact angle of drops as does Young–Laplace theory and also the same dependence of the volume of capillary condensate on vapor pressure as does the Kelvin equation. But our measurements of the contact angles of water on glass and Teflon and between their close-spaced surfaces contradict the YL supposition that meniscus angles are the same as angles of drops on glass and Teflon surfaces and support the PE postulate that attraction by the external fields of solids, not meniscus curvature, is responsible for capillary rise. We use published data to illustrate the validity of the PE conclusion that divergence or convergence at the saturation pressure of a parent liquid depends on whether or not the attractive field of a solid surface imparts to the liquid more than twice the energy required to create two liquid-vapor interfaces. For divergent water films on quartz, the PE equation provides a quantitative fit to experimental data for films of any thickness greater than 1.5 nm. No previous theory has accomplished that. In an appendix, we illustrate applications of PE theory to evaluating the complex interactions between inherently reversible chemical diffusion and inherently irreversible forces introduced by strains.},

Fully three-dimensional images were collected at points on the primary drainage curve and on the secondary imbibition and drainage loops. Analysis of the high-resolution images (17 micron voxels) allows for computation of interfacial areas and saturation. Corresponding pressure measurements are made during the course of the experiments. Results show the fluid-fluid interfacial area increasing as saturation decreases, reaching a maximum at saturations ranging from 20 to 35\% and then decreasing as the saturation continues to zero. The findings support results of numerical studies reported in the literature.},

We find that the gas relative permeability is approximately half as much in a oil-wet medium than in an water-wet medium at the same gas saturation. The water relative permeability in the water-wet medium and the oil relative permeability in the oil-wet medium are similar. In the water-wet medium the oil relative permeability scales as k ro ∼ S o 4 for S o {\textbackslash}textgreater S or, where S or is the waterflood residual oil saturation. With octane as the oil phase, k ro ∼ S o 2 for S o {\textbackslash}textless S or, while with decane as the oil phase, k ro falls sharply for S o {\textbackslash}textless S or. The water relative permeability in the oil-wet medium resembles the oil relative permeability in the water-wet medium for a non-spreading oil such as decane. These observations can be explained in terms of wetting, spreading, and the pore scale configurations of fluid.},

We demonstrate that a significant amount of residual oil left behind after waterflooding can be recovered by both near-miscible gas and SWAG injection. In particular, we show that in both processes, the recovery of the contacted residual oil continues behind the main gas front and ultimately all of the oil that can be contacted by the gas will be recovered. This oil is recovered by a microscopic mechanism, which is strongly linked to the low IFT between the oil and gas and to the perfect spreading of the oil over water, both of which occur as the critical point of the gas–oil system is approached. Ultimate oil recovery by near-miscible SWAG injection was as high as near-miscible gas injection with SWAG injection using much less gas compared to gas injection. Comparison of the results of SWAG experiments with two different gas fractional flow values (SWAG ratio) of 0.5 and 0.2 shows that fractional flow of the near-miscible gas injected simultaneously with water is not a crucial factor for ultimate oil recovery. This makes SWAG injection an attractive IOR (improved oil recovery) process especially for reservoirs, where continuous and high-rate gas injection is not possible (e.g. due to supply constraint).},

The two main flow mechanisms which account for this type of remobilization are simulated. These are the double-drainage mechanism and (countercurrent) film flow of oil. The simulations agree qualitatively with experimental findings in the literature. We also simulate steady-state three-phase flow (fixed and equal saturations) in a small segment of a waterwet porous medium under both spreading and nonspreading conditions.

	abstract = {Pore networks derived from synchrotron X-ray microtomographic images of reservoir rocks were used to provide realistic geometries for simulation of oil displacement by water. The Lattice Boltzmann Method was used to compute two-phase flow dynamics with constant pore geometry—but different pressure driving forces and imposed wettability distributions at the pore wall boundaries. Such examinations can be used to formulate more physically meaningful functional forms for multiphase flow relations to replace empirical constructs of relative permeability with only implicit dependencies on wettability and pore structure. Each simulation started with the same low initial water saturation distribution achieved by primary drainage network simulation in an initially strongly water-wet, reasonably homogeneous pore system. Mixed-wet scenarios were produced by altering the boundary conditions of those surfaces contacted by the non-wetting phase in the initial water distribution image. In one set of simulations comparing water-wet and mixed-wet boundary conditions, capillary numbers in the vicinity of 10−4 were not low enough for differences in wettability to give markedly different displacement dynamics. In a second set of simulations, as the driving force for flow was reduced further, we saw differences in the fluid distributions, but only minor changes in the relative permeabilities extracted from simulation output. The biggest difference between waterflood simulations with different wettabilities appears to be the additional recovery possible after breakthrough in the mixed-wet scenario. Capillary pressure, and not relative permeability, controls whether or not a particular saturation state can be observed. It is therefore concluded that capturing wettability effects in capillary pressure relations is probably more important than trying to roll such effects into relative permeability functions. Wettability is expected to play a more important role in heterogeneous systems.},

Wettability alteration allows any values for the advancing and receding oil-water, gas-water, and gas-oil contact angles to be assigned. Multiple phases can be present in each pore or throat (element), in wetting and spreading layers, as well as occupying the center of the pore space.

The former generates the interfacial tension, and the latter eliminates the over anti-diffusion effect of the recoloring step. The method was validated by numerical experiments on the Laplace's law and dynamics of spreading, and the drainage and imbibition processes of real cores were then simulated. The simulations were carried out on graphics processing units (GPUs) using Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) and message passing interface (MPI), which was proven to be very efficient.},

Furthermore, a new variable, the capillary field, is introduced to characterize the capillary force under dynamic situations, and a force-balance concept is presented to relate flow rates to pore-scale forces—dynamic pressure gradient and the capillary field. This description of the flow has the potential to be used in pore-network models to study the effect of pore-scale structures on the flow at larger scales.

The proposed procedure is based on fitting a sum of three parametric expressions to the histogram of α-values. The terms include two normal probability-density functions to account for noisy pure-phase values, and an analytical expression to account for intermediate values due to interface-containing voxels and blurring. To test the method, it was applied to several X-ray CT data sets of two-phase systems with known volume fractions and varying α-ranges, including a system with only about one standard deviation difference between the mean phase α-values, i.e., with substantial overlap between the noisy pure-phase distributions. The accuracy for the considered cases was found to be approximately 2 vol\% or better.

	abstract = {Pore-network modelling is commonly used to predict capillary pressure and relative permeability functions for multi-phase flow simulations. These functions strongly depend on the presence of fluid films and layers in pore corners. Recently, van Dijke and Sorbie (J. Coll. Int. Sci. 293:455–463, 2006) obtained the new thermodynamically derived criterion for oil layers existence in the pore corners with non-uniform wettability caused by ageing. This criterion is consistent with the thermodynamically derived capillary entry pressures for other water invasion displacements and it is more restrictive than the previously used geometrical layer collapse criterion. The thermodynamic criterion has been included in a newly developed two-phase flow pore network model, as well as two versions of the geometrical criterion. The network model takes as input networks extracted from pore space reconstruction methods or CT images. Furthermore, a new n-cornered star shape characterization technique has been implemented, based on shape factor and dimensionless hydraulic radius as input parameters. For two unstructured networks, derived from a Berea sandstone sample, oil residuals have been estimated for different wettability scenarios, by varying the contact angles in oil-filled pores after ageing from weakly to strongly oil-wet. Simulation of primary drainage, ageing and water invasion show that the thermodynamical oil layer existence criterion gives more realistic oil residual saturations compared to the geometrical criteria. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis has been carried out of oil residuals with respect to end-point capillary pressures. For strongly oil-wet cases residuals increase strongly with increasing end-point capillary pressures, contrary to intermediate oil-wet cases.},

Classical lattice Boltzmann methods for this problem, e.g. the colour gradient method or the free energy approach, can only be applied when density and viscosity ratios are small. Moreover, they use additional fields defined on the whole domain to describe the different phases and model phase separation by special interactions at each node. In contrast, our approach simulates the flow using a single field and separates the fluid phases by a free moving interface. The scheme is based on the lattice Boltzmann method and uses the level set method to compute the evolution of the interface. To couple the fluid phases, we develop new boundary conditions which realise the macroscopic jump conditions at the interface and incorporate surface tension in the lattice Boltzmann framework. Various simulations are presented to validate the numerical scheme, e.g. two-phase channel flows, the Young–Laplace law for a bubble and viscous fingering in a Hele-Shaw cell. The results show that the method is feasible over a wide range of density and viscosity differences.},

Starting with a network representation of Berea sandstone, the pore size distribution is adjusted to match capillary pressure for different media, keeping the rank order of pore sizes and the network topology fixed. Then predictions of single and multiphase properties are made with no further adjustment of the model. We successfully predict relative permeability and oil recovery for water wet, oil wet, and mixed wet data sets. For water flooding we introduce a method for assigning contact angles to match measured wettability indices. The aim of this work is not simply to match experiments but to use easily acquired data to predict difficult to measure properties. Furthermore, the variation of these properties in the field, due to wettability trends and different pore structures, can now be predicted reliably.},

	abstract = {We present results from a systematic study of relative permeability functions derived from two-phase lattice Boltzmann (LB) simulations on X-ray microtomography pore space images of Bentheimer and Berea sandstone. The simulations mimic both unsteady- and steady-state experiments for measuring relative permeability. For steady-state flow, we reproduce drainage and imbibition relative permeability curves that are in good agreement with available experimental steady-state data. Relative permeabilities from unsteady-state displacements are derived by explicit calculations using the Johnson, Bossler and Naumann method with input from simulated production and pressure profiles. We find that the nonwetting phase relative permeability for drainage is over-predicted compared to the steady-state data. This is due to transient dynamic effects causing viscous instabilities. Thus, the calculated unsteady-state relative permeabilities for the drainage is fundamentally different from the steady-state situation where transient effects have vanished. These effects have a larger impact on the invading nonwetting fluid than the defending wetting fluid. Unsteady-state imbibition relative permeabilities are comparable to the steady-state ones. However, the appearance of a piston-like front disguises most of the displacement and data can only be determined for a restricted range of saturations. Relative permeabilities derived from unsteady-state displacements exhibit clear rate effects, and residual saturations depend strongly on the capillary number. We conclude that the LB method can provide a versatile tool to compute multiphase flow properties from pore space images and to explore the effects of imposed flow and fluid conditions on these properties. Also, dynamic effects are properly captured by the method, giving the opportunity to examine differences between steady and unsteady-state setups.},

Our results are consistent with a free boundary condition at the gas/liquid interface, and with a no-flow boundary at the oil/water interface, when water is stationary, and a condition between a no-flow and a free-boundary when oil and water flow simultaneously. By studying oils with different spreading coefficients we measured the circumstances when oil layers form, and we compared the results with a simple geometric argument for oil layer existence. We also studied flow in uniformly oil-wet tubes. Overall, the work verifies and calibrates theoretical expressions for fluid conductance and layer formation that can be inputted into pore level network models to predict macroscopic properties, such as relative permeability.

Coupled with volume averaging techniques, these models can reproduce relationships between measured variables like capillary pressure, saturation, and relative permeability. In addition, these models allow nontraditional porous media variables to be quantified, such as interfacial areas and common line lengths. They also allow explorations of possible relationships between these variables, as well as testing of new theoretical conjectures. Herein we compute relationships between capillary pressure, saturation, interfacial areas, and common line lengths using a pore-scale network model. We then consider a conjecture that definition of an extended constitutive relationship between capillary pressure, saturation, and interfacial area eliminates hysteresis between drainage and imbibition; such hysteresis is commonly seen in the traditional relationship between capillary pressure and saturation. For the sample pore network under consideration, we find that hysteresis can essentially be eliminated using a specific choice of displacement rules; these rules are within the range of experimental observations for interface displacements and therefore are considered to be physically plausible. We find that macroscopic measures of common line lengths behave similarly to fluid–fluid interfacial areas, although the functional dependencies on capillary pressure and saturation differ to some extent.},

We compute the thickness and stability of this oil layer and show that appreciable recovery of oil by drainage only occurs when the oil layer occupies crevices or roughness in the pore space. We then analyze the distribution of oil, water and gas in vertical equilibrium for a spreading system, which is governed byα=γ ow (ρ o −ρ g )/γ go (ρ w −ρ o ), whereγ ow andγ go are the oil/water and gas/oil interfacial tensions respectively, andρ g ,ρ o andρ w are the gas, oil and water densities respectively. Ifα{\textbackslash}textgreater1, there is a height above the oil/water contact, beyond which connected oil only exists as a molecular film, with a negligible saturation. This height is independent of the structure of the porous medium. Whenα{\textbackslash}textless1, large quantities of oil remain in the pore space and gravity drainage is not efficient. If the initial spreading coefficient is negative, oil can be trapped and the recovery is also poor.

	abstract = {Nondestructive imaging methods such as X-ray computed tomography (CT) yield high-resolution, three-dimensional representations of pore space and fluid distribution within porous materials. Steadily increasing computational capabilities and easier access to X-ray CT facilities have contributed to a recent surge in microporous media research with objectives ranging from theoretical aspects of fluid and interfacial dynamics at the pore scale to practical applications such as dense nonaqueous phase liquid transport and dissolution. In recent years, significant efforts and resources have been devoted to improve CT technology, microscale analysis, and fluid dynamics simulations. However, the development of adequate image segmentation methods for conversion of gray scale CT volumes into a discrete form that permits quantitative characterization of pore space features and subsequent modeling of liquid distribution and flow processes seems to lag. In this paper we investigated the applicability of various thresholding and locally adaptive segmentation techniques for industrial and synchrotron X-ray CT images of natural and artificial porous media. A comparison between directly measured and image-derived porosities clearly demonstrates that the application of different segmentation methods as well as associated operator biases yield vastly differing results. This illustrates the importance of the segmentation step for quantitative pore space analysis and fluid dynamics modeling. Only a few of the tested methods showed promise for both industrial and synchrotron tomography. Utilization of local image information such as spatial correlation as well as the application of locally adaptive techniques yielded significantly better results.},

	abstract = {This work examines the influence of initial (i.e. post drainage) nonwetting (NW) fluid topology on total residual (i.e. after imbibition) NW phase saturation. Brine and air (used as a proxy for supercritical CO2) flow experiments were performed on Bentheimer sandstone; results were quantified via imaging with X-ray computed microtomography (X-ray CMT), which allows for three dimensional, non-destructive, pore-scale analysis of the amount, distribution, and connectivity of NW phase fluid within the sandstone cores. In order to investigate the phenomenon of fluid connectivity and how it changes throughout flow processes, the Bentheimer sandstone results are compared to previously collected X-ray CMT data from similar experiments performed in a sintered glass bead column, a loose packed glass bead column, and a column packed with crushed tuff. This allows us to interpret the results in a broader sense from the work, and draw conclusions of a more general nature because they are not based on a single pore geometry. Connectivity is quantified via the normalized Euler number of the NW fluid phase; the Euler number of a particular sample is normalized by the maximum connectivity of the media, i.e. the Euler number of the system at 100\% NW phase saturation. General connectivity-saturation relationships were identified for the various media. In terms of trapping, it was found that residual NW phase trapping is dependent on initial (i.e. post-drainage) NW phase connectivity as well as imbibition capillary number for the Bentheimer sandstone. Conversely, the sintered glass bead column exhibited no significant relationship between trapping and NW topology. These findings imply that for a CO2 sequestration scenario, capillary trapping is controlled by both the imbibition capillary number and the initial NW phase connectivity: as capillary number increases, and the normalized initial Euler number approaches a value of 1.0, capillary trapping is suppressed. This finding is significant to CO2 sequestration, because both the drainage (CO2 injection) and imbibition (subsequent water injection or infiltration) processes can be engineered in order to maximize residual trapping within the porous medium. Based on the findings presented here, we suggest that both the Euler number-saturation and the capillary number-saturation relationships for a given medium should be considered when designing a CO2 sequestration scenario.},

The sizes of the pores in the micromodel are in the range 3–30,μm and are the same as observed in the rock from which the image was taken. We conducted three-phase displacement experiments at low capillary numbers (in the order of 10-7) to observe the presence of predicted displacement mechanisms at the pore scale. We observed stable oil layers between the wetting phase (water) and the non-wetting phase (gas) for the water–decane–air system, which has a negative equilibrium spreading coefficient, as well as four different types of double displacements where one fluid displaces another that displaces a third. Double imbibition and double drainage are readily observed, but the existence of an oil layer surrounding the gas phase makes the other double displacement combinations very unlikely.},

	abstract = {Pore-network modelling is commonly used to predict capillary pressure and relative permeability functions for multi-phase flow simulations. These functions strongly depend on the presence of fluid films and layers in pore corners. Recently, van Dijke and Sorbie (J. Coll. Int. Sci. 293:455–463, 2006) obtained the new thermodynamically derived criterion for oil layers existence in the pore corners with non-uniform wettability caused by ageing. This criterion is consistent with the thermodynamically derived capillary entry pressures for other water invasion displacements and it is more restrictive than the previously used geometrical layer collapse criterion. The thermodynamic criterion has been included in a newly developed two-phase flow pore network model, as well as two versions of the geometrical criterion. The network model takes as input networks extracted from pore space reconstruction methods or CT images. Furthermore, a new n-cornered star shape characterization technique has been implemented, based on shape factor and dimensionless hydraulic radius as input parameters. For two unstructured networks, derived from a Berea sandstone sample, oil residuals have been estimated for different wettability scenarios, by varying the contact angles in oil-filled pores after ageing from weakly to strongly oil-wet. Simulation of primary drainage, ageing and water invasion show that the thermodynamical oil layer existence criterion gives more realistic oil residual saturations compared to the geometrical criteria. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis has been carried out of oil residuals with respect to end-point capillary pressures. For strongly oil-wet cases residuals increase strongly with increasing end-point capillary pressures, contrary to intermediate oil-wet cases.},

We propose a new technique for discretizing the Poisson equation on this octree grid. The resulting linear system is symmetric positive definite enabling the use of fast solution methods such as preconditioned conjugate gradients, whereas the standard approximation to the Poisson equation on an octree grid results in a non-symmetric linear system which is more computationally challenging to invert. The semi-Lagrangian characteristic tracing technique is used to advect the velocity, smoke density, and even the level set making implementation on an octree straightforward. In the case of smoke, we have multiple refinement criteria including object boundaries, optical depth, and vorticity concentration. In the case of water, we refine near the interface as determined by the zero isocontour of the level set function.},

The corresponding capillary pressures exhibit maxima with infiltration volume (minima with drainage), corresponding to critical pressures for engulfment of the spheres by the liquid (vapor). The analysis also reveals the formation of residual pendular rings of the wetting phase around particle contacts. Pendular ring formation is explored further by analyzing hexagonally packed spheres separated by 1/10 their radius.

	abstract = {We present a pore-scale study of two-phase relative permeability in homogenous-wet porous media, and porous media altered to a mixed-wet state. A Shan-Chen type multicomponent lattice Boltzmann (LB) model is employed to determine pore-scale fluid distributions and relative permeability. Mixed-wet states are created by altering the wettability of solid surfaces in contact with the nonwetting phase at the end of steady state simulation of initially homogenous-wet porous media. To ensure accurate representation of fluid-solid interfacial areas, we compare LB simulation results to experimental measurements of interfacial fluid-fluid and fluid-solid areas determined by X-ray computed microtomography imaging of water and oil distributions in bead packs. The LB simulations are found to match experimental trends observed for fluid-fluid and fluid-solid interfacial area-saturation relationships. The relative permeability of both fluids in the homogenous-wet porous media was found to decrease with a decreasing contact angle. The relative permeability of both fluids in the altered, mixed-wet porous media was found to decrease for all mixed-wet states in comparison to the initial homogenous-wet states. The nonwetting phase relative permeability decreased significantly, while the wetting phase experienced only a minor decrease. The significance of the decrease was found to be dependent on the distribution of the unaltered solid surfaces, with less dependence on the severity of alteration.},

Next, schemes are introduced and developed based on the weaker concept of positive coefficient approximations for homogeneous Hamiltonians. These schemes possess a discrete maximum principle on arbitrary triangulations and exhibit local Lipschitz continuity of the numerical Hamiltonian. Finally, a class of Petrov–Galerkin approximations is considered. These schemes are stabilized via a least-squares bilinear form. The Petrov–Galerkin schemes do not possess a discrete maximum principle but generalize to high order accuracy. Discretization of the level set equation also requires the numerical approximation of a mean curvature term. A simple mass-lumped Galerkin approximation is presented in Section 6 and analyzed using maximum principle analysis. The use of unstructured meshes permits several forms of mesh adaptation which have been incorporated into numerical examples. These numerical examples include discretizations of convex and nonconvex forms of the H-J equation, the Eikonal equation, and the level set equation.},

The observed flow coupling between water and oil is stronger in three-phase flow than two-phase flow, and cannot be observed in steady-state measurements. The results suggest that the oil is transported through moving gas-oil-water interfaces (form drag) or momentum transport across stationary interfaces (friction drag).

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider the relationships between wettability and three-phase pore occupancy in simple systems of arbitrary wettability, defined in terms of the oil–water contact angle, θow, of a pore. When θow changes, the remaining contact angles θgw and θgo also vary, consistent with available limited experimental data and a theoretical constraint equation. This equation was derived originally by Bartell and Osterhof [Ind. Eng. Chem. 19 (11) (1927) 1277] and applied more recently by Zhou and Blunt [J. Contam. Hydrol. 25 (1997)]. The consequences of this theory on several aspects of three-phase flow in mixed-wet and fractionally wet systems are discussed, in particular the issues of fluid–fluid wetting order, capillary displacement invariants, pore occupancy and saturation-dependencies of three-phase relative permeabilities. The model of pore occupancy leads to quite complex saturation-dependencies of the corresponding three-phase relative permeabilities. In case of distributed contact angles in both the water-wet and oil-wet pore clusters, all of the three-phase relative permeabilities depend on two saturations in a complex manner for most saturation combinations. In the general case, where the three-phase relative permeabilities cannot be related simply to the underlying two-phase relative permeabilities, a process-based model based on the pore scale physics is required. Given the great importance of the constraint equation, we recommend further experimental measurements of three-phase interfacial tension-contact angle data to establish the actual relationship between the three contact angles.},

	abstract = {We present a semi-analytical, combinatorial approach to compute three-phase capillary entry pressures for gas invasion into pore throats with constant cross-sections of arbitrary shapes that are occupied by oil and/or water. For a specific set of three-phase capillary pressures, geometrically allowed gas/oil, oil/water and gas/water arc menisci are determined by moving two circles in opposite directions along the pore/solid boundary for each fluid pair such that the contact angle is defined at the front circular arcs. Intersections of the two circles determine the geometrically allowed arc menisci for each fluid pair. The resulting interfaces are combined systematically to allow for all geometrically possible three-phase configuration changes. The three-phase extension of the Mayer and Stowe – Princen method is adopted to calculate capillary entry pressures for all determined configuration candidates, from which the most favorable gas invasion configuration is determined. The model is validated by comparing computed three-phase capillary entry pressures and corresponding fluid configurations with analytical solutions in idealized triangular star-shaped pores. It is demonstrated that the model accounts for all scenarios that have been analyzed previously in these shapes. Finally, three-phase capillary entry pressures and associated fluid configurations are computed in throat cross-sections extracted from segmented SEM images of Bentheim sandstone. The computed gas/oil capillary entry pressures account for the expected dependence of oil/water capillary pressure in spreading and non-spreading fluid systems at the considered wetting conditions. Because these geometries are irregular and include constrictions, we introduce three-phase displacements that have not been identified previously in pore-network models that are based on idealized pore shapes. However, in the limited number of pore geometries considered in this work, we find that the favorable displacements are not generically different from those already encountered in network models previously, except that the size and shape of oil layers that are surrounded by gas and water are described more realistically. The significance of the results for describing oil connectivity in porous media accurately can only be evaluated by including throats with more complex cross-sections in three-phase pore-network models.},

	abstract = {Various formulations of the governing equations that describe three-phase (e.g., water, oil, and gas) flow in porous media, including phase, global, and pseudo-global pressure-saturation formulations, are discussed in this paper. Comparisons of these differential formulations are theoretically and numerically presented for the first time. It is shown that the global pressure-saturation formulation is the most efficient one from the computational point of view in the case where the three-phase relative permeability and capillary pressure curves satisfy a so-called total differential condition, the pseudo-global formulation is useful when the fractional flow functions of the water and gas phases are close to their respective mean values, and the phase formulation can be applied generally.},

As in two-phase flow, the sequence of throat invasions in three-phase flow is determined by fluid connectivity and threshold capillary pressure for the invading interface. Flow through wetting and intermediate spreading films is important in determining fluid recoveries and the progress of the displacement in three-phase flow. Viscous pressure drops associated with flow through films give rise to multiple filling and emptying of pores. A three-phase, two-dimensional network model based on the pore-scale fluid distributions and displacement mechanisms reported by Øren et al. and which accounts for flow through both wetting and intermediate fluid films is shown to correctly predict all the important characteristics of three-phase flow observed in glass micromodel experiments.},

The overall method maintains a smooth geometrical description of the interface and the implementation simplicity characteristic of the level set method. Our method compares favorably with volume of fluid methods in the conservation of mass and purely Lagrangian schemes for interface resolution. The method is presented in three spatial dimensions.},

	abstract = {The capabilities of three volume-of-fluid methods for the calculation of surface tension-dominant two-phase flows are tested. The accurate calculation of the interface remains a problem for the volume-of-fluid method if the surface tension force plays an important role and the density ratios of the fluids in different phases are high. The result can be an artificial velocity field at the interface (“parasitic currents”), which can destabilize the interface significantly. The three different algorithms compared can be distinguished by their methods to compute the surface tension force, namely, the method using a kernel function for smoothing the discontinuity at the interface, a combined level-set and volume-of-fluid approach and a parabolic reconstruction of surface tension. The test cases consist of an equilibrium rod, a capillary wave and the Rayleigh–Taylor instability. The analytical solutions for each problem serve to examine the accuracy and the convergence behavior of each approach. Finally, the slow formation of a gas bubble at an underwater orifice was computed with the combined level-set and volume-of-fluid method and the results are compared with an analytical solution based on the Young–Laplace equation.},

	abstract = {A distinction is made between the surface Helmholtz free energy F, and the surface tension γ. The surface energy is the work necessary to form unit area of surface by a process of division: the surface tension is the tangential stress (force per unit length) in the surface layer; this stress must be balanced either by external forces or by volume stresses in the body. The surface tension of a crystal face is related to the surface free energy by the relation γ=F+A(dF/dA), where A is the area of the surface. For a one-component liquid, surface free energy and tension are equal. For crystals the surface tension is not equal to the surface energy. The standard thermodynamic formulae of surface physics are reviewed, and it is found that the surface free energy appears in the expression for the equilibrium contact angle, and in the Kelvin expression for the excess vapour pressure of small drops, but that the surface tension appears in the expression for the difference in pressure between the two sides of a curved surface. The surface tensions of inert-gas and alkali-halide crystals are calculated from expressions for their surface energies and are found to be negative. The surface tensions of homopolar crystals are zero if it is possible to neglect the interaction between atoms that are not nearest neighbours.},

The traditional averaging procedure leads to an equation of motion and a continuity equation expressed in terms of the volume-averaged pressure and velocity. The equation of motion contains integrals involving spatial deviations of the pressure and velocity, the Brinkman correction, and other lower-order terms. The analysis clearly indicates why the Brinkman correction should not be used to accommodate ano slip condition at an interface between a porous medium and a bounding solid surface. The presence of spatial deviations of the pressure and velocity in the volume-averaged equations of motion gives rise to aclosure problem, and representations for the spatial deviations are derived that lead to Darcy's law.

	abstract = {The study of capillarity is in the midst of a veritable explosion. Hence the temptation to write a new book, aiming at an audience of students. What is offered here is not a comprehensive review of the latest research but rather a compendium of principles. How does one turn a hydrophilic surface into one that is hydrophobic, and vice versa? We will describe a few solutions. Some rely on chemical treatments, such as coating a surface with a molecular layer. Others are based on physics, for instance by controlling the roughness of a surface. We will also examine the dynamics of wetting. Drops that spread spontaneously do so at a rate that slows down with time. They can be tricked into covering large areas by spreading them suddenly. We will describe a few of the many facets of their dynamical properties. Special additives are required for water to foam. Foams are desirable in a shampoo but can be a nightmare in a dishwasher detergent. Antifoam agents have been developed and are well known, but how do they work? It is also possible to generate bubbles and foams without special additives, for example in pure and viscous liquids such as glycerin, molten glass, and polymers. As we will see, the laws of draining and bursting then turn out to be quite different from the conventional ones. This book will enable the reader to understand in simple terms such questions that affect every day life – questions that also come up during in industry. The aim is to view systems that often prove quite complex in a way that isolates a particular physical phenomenon, often avoiding descriptions requiring advanced numerical techniques will oftentimes in favor of qualitative arguments. This strategy may at times jeopardize scientific rigor, but it makes it possible to grasp things efficiently and to invent novel situations.},

The speed may be an arbitrary function of curvature, and the front also can be passively advected by an underlying flow. These algorithms approximate the equations of motion, which resemble Hamilton-Jacobi equations with parabolic right-hand sides, by using techniques from hyperbolic conservation laws. Non-oscillatory schemes of various orders of accuracy are used to solve the equations, providing methods that accurately capture the formation of sharp gradients and cusps in the moving fronts. The algorithms handle topological merging and breaking naturally, work in any number of space dimensions, and do not require that the moving surface be written as a function. The methods can be also used for more general Hamilton-Jacobi-type problems. We demonstrate our algorithms by computing the solution to a variety of surface motion problems.},

	abstract = {A stable discretization of the lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE) for non-ideal gases is presented for simulation of incompressible two-phase flows having high density and viscosity ratios. The stiffness of the discretized forcing terms in LBE for non-ideal gases is known to trigger severe numerical instability and restrict practical application of the LBE method. Use of a proper pressure updating scheme is also crucial to the stability of the LBE method because of non-negligible pressure variation across the phase interface. To deal with these issues, we propose a stable discretization scheme, which assumes the low Mach number approximation, and utilizes the stress and potential forms of the surface tension force, the incompressible transformation, and the consistent discretization of the intermolecular forcing terms. The proposed stable discretization scheme is applied to simulate 1-D advection equation with a source term, a stationary droplet, droplet oscillation and droplet splashing and deposition on a thin film at a density ratio of 1000 with varying Reynolds numbers. The numerical solutions of stationary and oscillatory droplets agree well with analytic solutions including the Laplace’s law. The time history of the spread factor of the liquid sheet emitted after the droplet impact also follows the known spreading power law.},

	abstract = {An accurate description of the mechanics of pore level displacement of immiscible fluids could significantly improve the predictions from pore network models of capillary pressure–saturation curves, interfacial areas and relative permeability in real porous media. If we assume quasi-static displacement, at constant pressure and surface tension, pore scale interfaces are modeled as constant mean curvature surfaces, which are not easy to calculate. Moreover, the extremely irregular geometry of natural porous media makes it difficult to evaluate surface curvature values and corresponding geometric configurations of two fluids. Finally, accounting for the topological changes of the interface, such as splitting or merging, is nontrivial. We apply the level set method for tracking and propagating interfaces in order to robustly handle topological changes and to obtain geometrically correct interfaces. We describe a simple but robust model for determining critical curvatures for throat drainage and pore imbibition. The model is set up for quasi-static displacements but it nevertheless captures both reversible and irreversible behavior (Haines jump, pore body imbibition). The pore scale grain boundary conditions are extracted from model porous media and from imaged geometries in real rocks. The method gives quantitative agreement with measurements and with other theories and computational approaches.},

	abstract = {By means of a density functional approach the phase equilibria of a simple fluid confined by two adsorbing walls have been investigated as a function of wall separation H and chemical potential μ for temperature T corresponding to both partial and complete wetting situations. For large values of H and small undersaturations Δμ ≡ μsat−μ, we recover the macroscopic formulas for the undersaturation at which a first‐ order phase transition (capillary condensation) from dilute ‘‘gas’’ to a dense ‘‘liquid’’ occurs in a single, infinitely long slit. For smaller H we compute the lines of coexistence between gas and liquid in the (Δμ, 1/H) plane at fixed values of T. The adsorption Γ(Δμ), at fixed T and H, is characterized by a loop. At the first order transition Γ jumps discontinuously by a finite amount; however metastable states exist and these could give rise to hysteresis of the adsorption isotherms obtained for the single slit. The loop disappears at a capillary critical point (Δμc, 1/Hc) at each T. For H{\textbackslash}textlessHc, or Δμ{\textbackslash}textgreaterΔμc, condensation can no longer occur and no metastable states are present. The location of the critical points is described and for a complete wetting situation we find that these lie outside the bulk two phase region. Our theory provides a simple explanation of phase transitions observed in earlier computer simulations and mean‐field lattice gas calculations for confined fluids and suggests that measurements of the forces between plates, either by simulation or in real fluids, should provide rather direct information about capillary condensation and, possibly, capillary critical points. The relevance of our results for adsorption experiments on mesoporous solids is discussed briefly.},

	abstract = {Hysteresis in the relationship between capillary pressure ( P c ) , wetting phase saturation ( S w ) and nonwetting–wetting interfacial area per volume ( a nw ) is investigated using multiphase lattice-Boltzmann simulations of drainage and imbibition in a glass bead porous system. In order to validate the simulations, the P c – S w and a nw – S w main hysteresis loops were compared to experimental data reported by Culligan et al. [Culligan KA, Wildenschild D, Christensen BS, Gray WG, Rivers ML, Tompson AB. Interfacial area measurements for unsaturated flow through porous media. Water Resour Res 2004;40:W12413]. In general, the comparison shows that the simulations are reliable and capture the important physical processes in the experimental system. P c – S w curves, a nw – S w curves and phase distributions (within the pores) show good agreement during drainage, but less satisfactory agreement during imbibition. Drainage and imbibition scanning curves were simulated in order to construct P c – S w – a nw surfaces. The root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) between drainage and imbibition surfaces was 0.10 mm−1 and 0.03 mm−1, respectively. This small difference indicates that hysteresis is virtually nonexistent in the P c – S w – a nw relationship for the multiphase system studied here. Additionally, a surface was fit to the main loop (excluding scanning curves) of the drainage and imbibition P c – S w – a nw data and compared to the surface fit to all of the data. The differences between these two surfaces were small (RMSE = 0.05 mm−1 and MAE = 0.01 mm−1) indicating that the P c – S w – a nw surface is adequately represented without the need for the scanning curve data, which greatly reduces the amount of data required to construct the non-hysteretic P c – S w – a nw surface for this data.},

	abstract = {A gas-phase miscible-displacement method, using decane as an interfacial tracer, was used to measure air-water interfacial areas for a sand with water contents ranging from ∼2\% to 20\%. The expected trend of decreasing interfacial areas with increasing water contents was observed. The maximum estimated interfacial area of 19,500 cm−1 appears reasonable given it is smaller than the measured surface area of the porous medium (60,888 cm−1). Comparison of the experimental data presented herein with literature data provided further insight into the characterization of the air-water interface in unsaturated porous media. Specifically, comparison of interfacial areas measured using gas-phase versus aqueous-phase methods indicates that the gas-phase method generally yields larger interfacial areas than the aqueous-phase methods, even when accounting for differences in water content and physical properties of the porous media. The observations are consistent with proposed differences in interfacial accessibility of the aqueous- and gas-phase tracers. Evaluation of the data in light of functional interfacial domains, described herein, yields the hypothesis that aqueous interfacial tracers measure primarily air-water interfaces formed by “capillary water,” while gas-phase tracers measure air-water interfaces formed by both capillary and surface-adsorbed (film) water. The gas- and aqueous-phase methods may each provide interfacial area information that is more relevant to specific problems of interest. For example, gas-phase interfacial area measurements may be most relevant to contaminant transport in unsaturated systems, where retention at the air-water interface may be significant. Conversely, the aqueous-phase methods may yield information with direct bearing on multiphase flow processes that are dominated by capillary-phase behavior.},

This has been motivated by the widespread occurrence of subsurface contamination problems involving sparingly soluble liquids, often referred to as non-aqueous phase liquids (NAPLs). NAPL contamination problems require analysis of the simultaneous movement of at least two fluid phases, NAPL and water. This is somewhat different than the traditional multiphase flow problem in hydrology, namely water movement in unsaturated soils. In the traditional treatment of unsaturated systems, the movement of air, the non-aqueous phase, is not of interest, and its movement is ignored. Both NAPL-water and air-water systems are similar in that capillary forces, acting at the pore scale, usually dictate the pore-scale distribution of each fluid phase. Pore-scale fluid distributions then dictate the continuum-scale properties such as relative saturation and relative permeability.},

	abstract = {To predict multiphase flow through geologically realistic porous media, it is necessary to have a three-dimensional (3D) representation of the pore space. We use multiple-point statistics based on two-dimensional (2D) thin sections as training images to generate geologically realistic 3D pore-space representations. Thin-section images can provide multiple-point statistics, which describe the statistical relation between multiple spatial locations and use the probability of occurrence of particular patterns. Assuming that the medium is isotropic, a 3D image can be generated that preserves typical patterns of the void space seen in the thin sections. The method is tested on Berea sandstone for which a 3D image from micro-CT (Computerized Tomography) scanning is available and shows that the use of multiple-point statistics allows the long-range connectivity of the structure to be preserved, in contrast to two-point statistics methods that tend to underestimate the connectivity. Furthermore, a high-resolution 2D thin-section image of a carbonate reservoir rock is used to reconstruct 3D structures by the proposed method. The permeabilities of the statistical images are computed using the lattice-Boltzmann method (LBM). The results are similar to the measured values, to the permeability directly computed on the micro-CT image for Berea and to predictions using analysis of the 2D images and the effective medium approximation.},

	abstract = {In fractured reservoirs, the efficiency of water flood is governed by spontaneous imbibition of water into oil-containing matrix blocks. When the matrix is oil-wet or mixed-wet, little oil can be recovered by imbibition. The objective of this work is to identify chemicals that can be added to the injection water that can induce imbibition into an originally mixed-wet, tight, fractured sandstone reservoir. Several surfactants were evaluated for their aqueous stability at the reservoir temperature and salinity. Contact angles were measured on a clay-rich sandstone. Spontaneous imbibition tests were conducted on the reservoir rocks. It is shown that the use of dilute (0.1 wt \%) anionic surfactant solution with a large number of ethoxy groups can alter the wettability from oil-wet toward more water-wet conditions on the mineral plates. Incremental oil recovery as high as 68\% original oil in place is obtained through spontaneous imbibition experiments performed on tight (?10 ?D) oil-wet/mixed-wet sandstone reservoir cores. A three-dimensional fine grid mechanistic simulator was used to perform lab-scale validation and parametric analysis. Parametric studies show that the rate of oil recovery increases with increasing wettability alteration, increasing fracture density, and decreasing oil viscosity.},

Because of its Lagrangian particle nature, SPH has several advantages for modeling Navier–Stokes flow and reactive transport including: (1) in a Lagrangian framework there is no non-linear term in the momentum conservation equation, so that accurate solutions can be obtained for momentum dominated flows and; (2) complicated physical and chemical processes such as surface growth due to precipitation/dissolution and chemical reactions are easy to implement. In addition, SPH simulations explicitly conserve mass and linear momentum. The SPH solution of the diffusion equation with fixed and moving reactive solid–fluid boundaries was compared with analytical solutions, Lattice Boltzmann [Q. Kang, D. Zhang, P. Lichtner, I.

	abstract = {Conventional models of liquid distribution, flow, and solute transport in partially saturated porous media are limited by the representation of media pore space as a bundle of cylindrical capillaries (BCC). Moreover, the capillary model ignores the dominant contribution of adsorptive surface forces and liquid films at low potentials. We propose two new complementary elements for improving our understanding of liquid configuration in porous media: (1) an approach for considering the individual contributions of adsorptive and capillary forces to the matric potential and (2) a more realistic model for pore space geometry. Modern interface science formalism is applied to determine the thickness of adsorbed liquid films as a function of thermodynamic conditions and specific surface area of the medium. The augmented Young-Laplace (AYL) equation provided the necessary framework for combining adsorptive and capillary processes. A new pore space geometry composed of an angular pore cross section (for capillary processes) connected to slit-shaped spaces with internal surface area (for adsorption processes) offers a more realistic representation of natural porous media with explicit consideration of surface area (absent in the standard BCC model). Liquid-vapor configuration, saturation, and liquid-vapor interfacial area were calculated for different potentials and pore (unit cell) dimensions. Pore dimensions may be easily related to measurable soil properties such as specific surface area and porosity. Rigorous calculations based on the AYL equation were simplified and led to the development of algebraic expressions relating saturation and interfacial area of liquid in the proposed pore space geometry to chemical potential. These simple expressions are amenable to upscaling procedures similar to those presently used with the BCC model.},

We discuss the hysteresis trends in the water and gas relative permeabilities and compare the behavior of water-wet and oil-wet media. We interpret the results in terms of pore-scale displacements. In water-wet media the water relative permeability is lower during water injection in the presence of gas due to an increase in oil/water capillary pressure that causes a decrease in wetting layer conductance. The gas relative permeability is higher for displacement cycles after first gas injection at high gas saturation due to cooperative pore filling, but lower at low saturation due to trapping. In oil-wet media, the water relative permeability remains low until water-filled elements span the system at which point the relative permeability increases rapidly. The gas relative permeability is lower in the presence of water than oil because it is no longer the most non-wetting phase.},

	abstract = {Synchrotron-based X-ray microtomography (micro CT) at the Advanced Light Source (ALS) line 8.3.2 at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory produces three-dimensional micron-scale-resolution digital images of the pore space of the reservoir rock along with the spacial distribution of the fluids. Pore-scale visualization of carbon dioxide flooding experiments performed at a reservoir pressure demonstrates that the injected gas fills some pores and pore clusters, and entirely bypasses the others. Using 3D digital images of the pore space as input data, the method of maximal inscribed spheres (MIS) predicts two-phase fluid distribution in capillary equilibrium. Verification against the tomography images shows a good agreement between the computed fluid distribution in the pores and the experimental data. The model-predicted capillary pressure curves and tomography-based porosimetry distributions compared favorably with the mercury injection data. Thus, micro CT in combination with modeling based on the MIS is a viable approach to study the pore-scale mechanisms of CO2 injection into an aquifer, as well as more general multi-phase flows.},

Multiphase flow and displacement can pose a rather difficult problem, both because the underlying physics is complex, and also because standard laboratory investigation reveals little about the mechanisms that control micro-scale processes. X-ray microtomographic imaging is a non-destructive technique for quantifying these processes in three dimensions within individual pores, and as we report here, with rapidly increasing spatial and temporal resolution.},

	abstract = {A novel semi-analytical model for computation of capillary entry pressures and associated fluid configurations in arbitrary, potentially non-convex, 2D pore space geometries at uniform wettability is developed. The model computes all possible centre positions of circular arcs, and physically sound criteria are implemented to determine the set of these arcs that correspond to geometrically allowed interfaces. Interfaces and pore boundary segments are connected to form closed boundaries of identified geometrical regions. These regions are classified as either oil regions, located in the wider parts of the pore space, or as water regions located in pore space constrictions. All possible region combinations are identified and evaluated for each radius value in an iterative procedure to determine the favourable entry radius and corresponding configuration based on minimisation of free energy. The model has been validated by comparison with known analytical solutions in idealised pore geometries. In cases where different analytical solutions are geometrically possible, the model generates several oil and water regions, and the valid solution is determined by the region combination that corresponds to the most favourable entry pressure, consistent with the analytical solution. Entry pressure radii and configurations are computed in strongly non-convex pore spaces extracted from an image of Bentheimer sandstone, which demonstrates that the model captures successfully well-known characteristics of capillary behaviour at different wetting conditions. The computations also demonstrate the importance of selecting the fluid configuration of minimum change in free energy. In some cases, a merged region formed by a combination of oil and water regions corresponds to the favourable entry configuration of oil, whereas in other cases, an individual oil region may correspond to the favourable oil entry configuration. It is also demonstrated that oil entry configurations may constitute merged regions for weakly water-wet conditions and individual oil regions for strongly water-wet conditions in the same pore space. The computations show that the ratio of pore area to perimeter multiplied by the cosine of the contact angle under-predicts the entry pressure radii in Bentheimer sandstone pore spaces. An alternative formula is proposed for prediction of entry radii for nonzero contact angles based on the entry radii obtained for zero contact angles.},

We report experimental observations of imbibition of an aqueous phase into square capillary tubes with uniform and mixed wetting. Each capillary had an oil-wet end to ensure that water imbibed in one direction only. Swelling of arc menisci in the corners of the square tubes and formation and movement of main terminal menisci were observed during water imbibition. Clean, strongly water-wet capillaries were studied with water displacing decane or air. Wetting was altered by exposing clean capillaries to crude oil or to decane with polar additives. Uniform changes in wetting were effected by filling the capillary with a single phase. Capillaries exposed first to brine, then drained with crude oil, became mixed-wet. The rates and amounts of oil produced are reported. For crude oil-treated capillaries, a consistent trend of decreased rate and extent of oil production with increased aging time emerged. Wetting alteration by polar and acid/base interactions was consistent with previously proposed interaction mechanisms based on contact angle observations.},

	abstract = {The creation of a 3D pore-scale model of a porous medium is often an essential step in quantitatively characterising the medium and predicting its transport properties. Here we describe a new stochastic pore space reconstruction approach that uses thin section images as its main input. The approach involves using a third-order Markov mesh where we introduce a new algorithm that creates the reconstruction in a single scan, thus overcoming the computational issues normally associated with Markov chain methods. The technique is capable of generating realistic pore architecture models (PAMs), and examples are presented for a range of fairly homogenous rock samples as well as for one heterogeneous soil sample. We then apply a Lattice–Boltzmann (LB) scheme to calculate the permeabilities of the PAMs, which in all cases closely match the measured values of the original samples. We also develop a set of software methods – referred to as pore analysis tools (PATs) – to quantitatively analyse the reconstructed pore systems. These tools reveal the pore connectivity and pore size distribution, from which we can simulate the mercury injection process, which in turn reproduces the measured curves very closely. Analysis of the topological descriptors reveals that a connectivity function based on the specific Euler number may serve as a simple predictor of the threshold pressure for geo-materials.},

In this contribution a `morphological path' is presented to generate a network model based on quantitative morphological investigations of the 3D pore geometry in order to predict soil hydraulic properties. The 3D-geometry of pores larger than 0.04 mm in diameter is obtained using serial sections through impregnated samples. Beside pore-size distribution an important topological aspect of pore geometry is the spatial connectivity of the pore space which is difficult to measure. A connectivity function is proposed defined by the 3D-Euler number. The goodness in the estimation of the Euler number using serial sections is investigated in subsamples of different sizes and shapes. Then, a simple network model is generated which can be adapted to a predefined pore-size distribution and connectivity function. Network simulations of hydraulic properties are compared to independent measurements at the same soil material and the effect of topology on water flow and solute transport is investigated. It is concluded that a rough estimation of pore-size distribution and topology defined by the connectivity function might be sufficient to predict hydraulic properties.},

Second-order temporal accuracy is achieved by virtue of a multidimensional unsplit time integration scheme. We detail our geometrically based solution method, in which material volume fluxes are computed systematically with a set of simple geometric tasks. We then interrogate the method by testing its ability to track interfaces through large, controlled topology changes, whereby an initially simple interface configuration is subjected to vortical flows.

	abstract = {In this paper, we develop a lattice Boltzmann model for simulating the transport and reaction of fluids in porous media. To simulate such a system, we account for the interaction of forced convection, molecular diffusion, and surface reaction. The problem is complicated by the evolution of the porous media geometry due to chemical reactions, which may significantly and continuously modify the hydrologic properties of the media. The particular application that motivates the present study is acid stimulation, a common technique used to increase production from petroleum reservoirs. This technique involves the injection of acid (e.g., hydrochloric acid, HCl, acetic acid, HAc) into the formation to dissolve minerals comprising the rock. As acid is injected, highly conductive channels or “wormholes” may be formed. The dissolution of carbonate rocks in 0.5M HCl and 0.5M HAc is simulated with the lattice Boltzmann model developed in this study. The dependence of dissolution process and the geometry of the final wormhole pattern on the acid type and the injection rate is studied. The results agree qualitatively with the experimental and theoretical analyses of others and substantiate the previous finding that there exists an optimal injection rate at which the wormhole is formed as well as the number of pore volumes of the injected fluid to break through is minimized. This study also confirms the experimentally observed phenomenon that the optimal injection rate decreases and the corresponding minimized number of pore volumes to break through increases as the acid is changed from HCl to HAc. Simulations suggest that the proposed lattice Boltzmann model may serve as an alternative reliable quantitative approach to study chemical dissolution in porous media.},

	abstract = {We present a three-dimensional network model to simulate two- and three-phase capillary dominated processes at the pore level. The displacement mechanisms incorporated in the model are based on the physics of multiphase flow observed in micromodel experiments. All the important features of immiscible fluid flow at the pore scale, such as wetting layers, spreading layers of the intermediate-wet phase, hysteresis, and wettability alteration are implemented in the model. Wettability alteration allows any values for the advancing and receding oil-water, gas-water, and gas-oil contact angles to be assigned. Multiple phases can be present in each pore or throat (element), in wetting and spreading layers, as well as occupying the center of the pore space. In all, some 30 different generic fluid configurations for two- and three-phase flow are analyzed. Double displacement and layer formation are implemented as well as direct two-phase displacement and layer collapse events. Every element has a circular, square, or triangular cross section. A random network that represents the pore space in Berea sandstone is used in this study. The model computes relative permeabilities, saturation paths, and capillary pressures for any displacement sequence. A methodology to track a given three-phase saturation path is presented that enables us to compare predicted and measured relative permeabilities on a point-by-point basis. A robust displacement-based clustering algorithm is also presented.},

The porous medium is modelled as a superposition of one solid continuum coexiting and interacting with an N-component fluid-phase continuum. Macroscopic balance laws derived in Part 1 provide the equations of mass and momentum for the mean motion of the fluid phase and diffusive motions of individual components. The Coleman and Noll's method of exploitation of the entropy inequality is applied to restrict a rather general set of constitutive equations. Gradients of the fluid-phase density and concentrations of N-1 components are included among independent variables to account for buoyancy and cross-coupling effects properly. Extensions of certain classical relations for fluid-phase pressure, solid stress tensor, and components' chemical potentials are obtained as results of the constitutive theory. Further simplifications and linearizations of constitutive equations and balance laws yield a general extension of Darcy's and Fick's laws, applicable to cases where the fluid has more than one main component. It is found out that both relations have to be modified to account for the effect of high concentrations. It is shown that classical forms of those laws are valid only if fluid components exists at low concentrations. All assumptions are carefully and explicitly stated during the course of development. As an illustration of the theory, proper forms of Darcy's and Fick's laws for the flow and transport of concentrated brine in porous media are given. The development here also provides a fundamental basis to equations used in the description of chemico-osmosis effects.},

Based on the classification of all allowed pore occupancies in a completely accessible porous medium, saturation-dependencies of the corresponding relative permeabilities are derived. Furthermore, three-phase relative permeabilities that appear to depend only on their own saturations are either linked to the corresponding two-phase relative permeabilities or it is shown that such a link cannot be established.

	abstract = {This book is an introduction to level set methods and dynamic implicit surfaces. These are powerful techniques for analyzing and computing moving fronts in a variety of different settings. While it gives many examples of the utility of the methods to a diverse set of applications, it also gives complete numerical analysis and recipes, which will enable users to quickly apply the techniques to real problems. The book begins with a description of implicit surfaces and their basic properties, then devises the level set geometry and calculus toolbox, including the construction of signed distance functions. Part II adds dynamics to this static calculus. Topics include the level set equation itself, Hamilton-Jacobi equations, motion of a surface normal to itself, re-initialization to a signed distance function, extrapolation in the normal direction, the particle level set method and the motion of co-dimension two (and higher) objects. Part III is concerned with topics taken from the fields of Image Processing and Computer Vision. These include the restoration of images degraded by noise and blur, image segmentation with active contours (snakes), and reconstruction of surfaces from unorganized data points. Part IV is dedicated to Computational Physics. It begins with one phase compressible fluid dynamics, then two-phase compressible flow involving possibly different equations of state, detonation and deflagration waves, and solid/fluid structure interaction. Next it discusses incompressible fluid dynamics, including a computer graphics simulation of smoke, free surface flows, including a computer graphics simulation of water, and fully two-phase incompressible flow. Additional related topics include incompressible flames with applications to computer graphics and coupling a compressible and incompressible fluid. Finally, heat flow and Stefan problems are discussed. A student or researcher working in mathematics, computer graphics, science, or engineering interested in any dynamic moving front, which might change its topology or develop singularities, will find this book interesting and useful.},

	abstract = {A simple process-based model of three-phase displacement cycles for both spreading and non-spreading oils in a mixed-wet capillary bundle model is presented. All possible pore filling sequences are determined analytically and it is found that the number of pore occupancies that are permitted on physical grounds is actually quite restricted. For typical non-spreading gas/oil/water systems, only two important cases need to be considered to see all types of allowed qualitative behaviour for non-spreading oils. These two cases correspond to whether water or gas is the ‘intermediate-wetting’ phase in oil-wet pores as determined by the corresponding contact angles, that is, cos θo gw {\textbackslash}textgreater 0 or cos θo gw {\textbackslash}textless 0, respectively. Analysis of the derived pore occupancies leads to the establishment of a number of relationships showing the phase dependencies of three-phase capillary pressures and relative permeabilities in mixed-wet systems. It is shown that different relationships hold in different regions of the ternary diagram and the morphology of these regions is discussed in terms of various rock/fluid properties. Up to three distinct phase-dependency regions may appear for a non-spreading oil and this reduces to two for a spreading oil. In each region, we find that only one phase may be specified as being the ‘intermediate-wetting’ phase and it is only the relative permeability of this phase and the capillary pressure between the two remaining phases that depend upon more than one saturation. Given the simplicity of the model, a remarkable variety of behaviour is predicted. Moreover, the emergent three-phase saturation-dependency regions developed in this paper should prove useful in: (a) guiding improved empirical approaches of how two-phase data should be combined to obtain the corresponding three-phase capillary pressures and relative permeabilities; and (b) determining particular displacement sequences that require additional investigation using a more complete process-based 3D pore-scale network model.},

In addition, the free surface can merge or break up with no special treatment. We maintain the level set function as the signed distance from the free surface in order to accurately compute flows with high density ratios and stiff surface tension effects. In this work, we couple the level set scheme to an adaptive projection method for the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations, in order to achieve higher resolution of the free surface with a minimum of additional expense.

Careful perusal of the early literature has revealed some unexpected historical aspects. For example, Young’s 1805 essay on the ‘cohesion of fluids’ was purely descriptive, but it did provide a basis for the ‘classical’ treatment of capillarity and wetting. In contrast, Laplace’s 1806 work involved a more ‘modern’ energetic approach to capillary attraction, but avoided any direct reference to surface tension. The related capillary condensation equation is now universally known as the Kelvin equation. However, this exponential relationship was not the form of the original equation proposed in 1871 by William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin). Zsigmondy (1911) [11] applied Thomson’s original linear equation in his seminal study of silica gels. Although the Kelvin equation is still widely used for mesopore size analysis, its limitations began to be recognised in the 1930s.},

Fluid components are miscible and homogenous thermodynamic interactions among them take place at the molecular level. Heterogeneous thermodynamic interactions occur between fluid components and the rock at solid-fluid interfaces. In the microscopic description of the medium, balance laws of continuum theories of mixtures are employed as the governing equations at points within the fluid phase. At points within the rock aggregates, classical balance equations of continuum mechanics are employed. Interfacial jump conditions are given to account for interactions between fluid species and the rock. By averaging of these three sets of equations, we arrive at macroscopic equations of balance of mass, momentum, energy and entropy for the rock and for individual fluid species, as well as restrictions on interaction terms. Also, a macroscopic formulation of the second law of thermodynamics for the medium is provided. Macroscopic balance laws will have to be supplemented by appropriate constitutive relations to obtain a complete thermodynamic theory of transport processes in porous media. This approach, both in concept and methodology, is the same as that developed by Hassanizadeh and Gray14–16. It makes it possible to take into account coupling of thermodynamic effects. Among the final results, we shall provide a generalization of Fick's Law and Darcy's for transport of concentrated brine in porous media.},

	abstract = {We reproduce the general behavior of complicated bubble and droplet motions using the variational level set formulation introduced by the authors earlier. Our approach here ignores inertial effects; thus the motion is only correct as an approximation for very viscous problems. However, the steady states are true equilibrium solutions. Inertial forces will be added in future work. The problems include: soap bubbles colliding and merging, drops falling or remaining attached to a (generally irregular) ceiling, and liquid penetrating through a funnel in both two and three dimensions. Each phase is identified with a particular “level set” function. The zero level set of this function is that particular phase boundary. The level set functions all evolve in time through a constrained gradient descent procedure so as to minimize an energy functional. The functions are coupled through physical constraints and through the requirements that different phases do not overlap and vacuum regions do not develop. Both boundary conditions and inequality constraints are cast in terms of (either local or global) equality constraints. The gradient projection method leads to a system of perturbed (by curvature, if surface tension is involved) Hamilton–Jacobi equations coupled through a constraint.

	abstract = {The interplay of viscous, gravity and capillary forces determines the flow behavior of two or more phases through porous materials. In this study, a rule-based dynamic network model is developed to simulate two-phase flow in three-dimensional porous media. A cubic network analog of porous medium is used with cubic bodies and square cross-section throats. The rules for phase movement and redistribution are devised to honor the imbibition and drainage physics at pore scale. These rules are based on the pressure field within the porous medium that is solved for by applying mass conservation at each node. The pressure field governs the movement and flow rates of the fluids within the porous medium. Film flow has been incorporated in a novel way. A pseudo-percolation model is proposed for low but non-zero capillary number (ratio of viscous to capillary forces). The model is used to study primary drainage with constant inlet flow rate and constant inlet pressure boundary conditions. Non-wetting phase front dynamics, apparent wetting residuals (Swr), and relative permeability are computed as a function of capillary number (Nca), viscosity ratio (M), and pore-throat size distribution. The simulation results are compared with experimental results from the literature. Depending upon the flow rate and viscosity ratio, the displacement front shows three distinct flow patterns—stable, viscous fingering and capillary fingering. Capillary desaturation curves (Swr vs. Nca) depend on the viscosity ratio. It is shown that at high flow rates (or high Nca), relative permeability assumes a linear dependence upon saturation. Pseudo-static capillary pressure curve is also estimated (by using an invasion percolation model) and is compared with the dynamic capillary pressure obtained from the model.},

	abstract = {This paper presents application of a series of algorithms used to extract pore network structure from high-resolution three-dimensional synchrotron microtomography images of unconsolidated porous media systems. These algorithms are based on the three-dimensional skeletonization that simplifies the pore space to networks in the form of nodes connected to paths. Dilation algorithms were developed to generate inscribed spheres on the nodes and paths of the medial axis to represent pore-bodies and pore-throats of the network, respectively. The end result is a physically representative pore network structure, i.e. three-dimensional spatial distribution (i.e. x-, y-, and z-coordinates) of pore-bodies and pore-throats, pore-body size distribution, pore-throat size distribution, and the connectivity. Systems analyzed in this study include different glass bead systems and natural marine sand. The media ranged in size from 0.123 to 1.0 mm, while the image volumes ranged between 7.7 and 108.9 mm3. In addition to extracting the pore network structure, the porosity, specific surface area, and representative elementary volume analysis on the porosity were calculated. Spatial correlation between pore-body sizes in the network was investigated using semivariograms and integral scale concepts. The impact of resolution on the calculated property was also investigated. In this work, we show that microtomography is an effective tool to non-destructively extract the structure of many systems. The quality of the datasets depends on photon energy, photon flux, size of the sample, type of the sample, and size of the sample ‘features’. Results show that the developed method of extracting pore network structure is applicable to ideal and natural porous media systems. The impact of resolution on the quantification of the network structure properties varies in its significance based on feature size of the system and the properties being calculated. Therefore, a thorough resolution sensitivity analysis should be carried out to determine the degree of error associated with a system imaged at a given resolution.},

These experiments were designed to provide quantitative evidence of important pore-scale displacement processes. A unique experimental approach using a two-dimensional synthetic porous medium (micromodel) and digital image analysis (DIA) enabled both measurement of three-fluid capillary pressure-saturation relationships and analysis of fluid behavior at the pore level. Experiments were pressure controlled, and were designed to mimic measurements typically performed on laboratory cores. Only quasi-static measurements were made, with a focus on capillary pressure-saturation relations. Different orders of fluid infiltration with respect to wettability were studied. DIA made it possible to obtain quantitative information about the experiments, including fluid saturations, saturation changes between pressure steps, and movement of apparently isolated fluids through films. The results provide insights into important pore-scale mechanisms and provide a basis for three-fluid pore-scale computations.},

In addition, LBM-like algorithms have been developed to solve microfluidics-related processes and phenomena, such as heat transfer, electric/magnetic field, and diffusion. This article provides a practical overview of these LBM models and implementation details for external force, initial condition, and boundary condition. Moreover, recent LBM applications in various microfluidic situations have been reviewed, including microscopic gaseous flows, surface wettability and solid–liquid interfacial slip, multiphase flows in microchannels, electrokinetic flows, interface deformation in electric/magnetic field, flows through porous structures, and biological microflows. These simulations show some examples of the capability and efficiency of LBM in computational microfluidics.},

	abstract = {We have measured the force of adhesion between two curved surfaces of molecularly smooth mica in the presence of water vapour and various organic vapours at relative vapour pressures in the range 0–0.99. We find that the annulus of capillary-condensed liquid around the contact zone does not affect the adhesion force unless the surface tension of the liquid γLV is greater than the (experimentally determined) surface free energy of the solid γSV. Under such conditions (when γLV \&gt;γSV) the meniscus force arising from the Laplace pressure dominates the adhesion, and for cyclohexane and other inert organic liquids the adhesion force is within about 10\% of that calculated from microscopic thermodynamics via the Young-Laplace equation for relative vapour pressures as low as 0.1. The Kelvin equation for capillary condensation, which is itself derived from the Young-Laplace equation, predicts that at these relative vapour pressures meniscus radii are of the order of one or two molecular diameters. The results therefore suggest that macroscopic thermodynamics is in principle applicable to such small menisci and — by extension — to liquids only a few molecules away from a solid—liquid interface. The results for water are quite different, and show that the adhesion force due to the Laplace pressure is within 10\% of that expected from bulk thermodynamics only for relative vapour pressure above 0.9, corresponding to Kelvin meniscus radii greater than 5 nm. This result may reflect the previously suspected long-range cooperative nature of the hydrogen bonding interaction in water, though the equally long-range effects of double-layer forces may also play a role in reducing the effective surface tension of water. The results are relevant to the problem of the applicability of macroscopic thermodynamics to microscopic liquid systems as well as on the effects of capillary condensed liquids on adhesion forces.},

The numerical method is developed for efficient modelling of multiphase flow in porous media with complex interface motion and irregular solid boundaries. The Navier–Stokes equations are discretised using a finite volume approach, while the volume-of-fluid method is used to capture the location of interfaces. Capillary forces are computed using a semi-sharp surface force model, in which the transition area for capillary pressure is effectively limited to one grid block. This new formulation along with two new filtering methods, developed for correcting capillary forces, permits simulations at very low capillary numbers and avoids non-physical velocities. Capillary forces are implemented using a semi-implicit formulation, which allows larger time step sizes at low capillary numbers. We verify the accuracy and stability of the numerical method on several test cases, which indicate the potential of the method to predict multiphase flow processes.},

	abstract = {We present a semi-analytical, combinatorial approach to compute three-phase capillary entry pressures for gas invasion into pore throats with constant cross-sections of arbitrary shapes that are occupied by oil and/or water. For a specific set of three-phase capillary pressures, geometrically allowed gas/oil, oil/water and gas/water arc menisci are determined by moving two circles in opposite directions along the pore/solid boundary for each fluid pair such that the contact angle is defined at the front circular arcs. Intersections of the two circles determine the geometrically allowed arc menisci for each fluid pair. The resulting interfaces are combined systematically to allow for all geometrically possible three-phase configuration changes. The three-phase extension of the Mayer and Stowe – Princen method is adopted to calculate capillary entry pressures for all determined configuration candidates, from which the most favorable gas invasion configuration is determined. The model is validated by comparing computed three-phase capillary entry pressures and corresponding fluid configurations with analytical solutions in idealized triangular star-shaped pores. It is demonstrated that the model accounts for all scenarios that have been analyzed previously in these shapes. Finally, three-phase capillary entry pressures and associated fluid configurations are computed in throat cross-sections extracted from segmented SEM images of Bentheim sandstone. The computed gas/oil capillary entry pressures account for the expected dependence of oil/water capillary pressure in spreading and non-spreading fluid systems at the considered wetting conditions. Because these geometries are irregular and include constrictions, we introduce three-phase displacements that have not been identified previously in pore-network models that are based on idealized pore shapes. However, in the limited number of pore geometries considered in this work, we find that the favorable displacements are not generically different from those already encountered in network models previously, except that the size and shape of oil layers that are surrounded by gas and water are described more realistically. The significance of the results for describing oil connectivity in porous media accurately can only be evaluated by including throats with more complex cross-sections in three-phase pore-network models.},

	abstract = {Modeling of multiphase flow in porous media requires that the physics of the phases present be well described. Additionally, the behavior of interfaces between those phases and of the common lines where the interfaces come together must be accounted for. One factor complicating this description is the fact that geometric variables such as the volume fractions, interfacial areas per volume, and common line length per volume enter the conservation equations formulated at the macroscale or core scale. These geometric densities, although important physical quantities, are responsible for a deficit in the number of dynamic equations needed to model the system. Thus, to obtain closure of the multiphase flow equations, one must supplement the conservation equations with additional evolutionary equations that account for the interactions among these geometric variables. Here, the second law of thermodynamics, the constraint that the energy of the system must be at a minimum at equilibrium, is used to motivate and generate linearized evolutionary equations for these geometric variables and interactions. The constitutive forms, along with the analysis of the mass, momentum, and energy conservation equations, provide a necessary complete set of equations for multiphase flow modeling in the subsurface.},

Most theoretical workers did not go beyond very simple capillary models with perfect symmetry, thus being unable to map experiments in real pores with rather complex structure. In this paper we deal with chemical inhomogeneity, produced by a periodic wall potential, that causes fluid attraction and repulsion altering along the walls. We observe a new mechanism of capillary condensation, characterized by a splitting of the equilibrium ‘‘gas–liquid’’ transition, and we concentrate on the crucial role the typical length for the wall inhomogeneity, λ, plays compared with the pore width, H. Our microscopic results are confirmed by a macroscopic analysis that leads to a modified Kelvin equation, giving a quantitative prediction of capillary condensation in structured pores. Furthermore our model explains the nature of the critical isochore as measured in mesopore condensation experiments by Thommes and Findenegg. © 1996 American Institute of Physics.},

	abstract = {The curvature of an interface in a pore depends upon the shape of the pore and the operative contact angle that the interface makes with the solid surface. Even relatively simple pores formed by the surfaces of equal spheres have a complex shape including nonaxisymmetric cross-section and converging-diverging geometry. For such pores, a theory for meniscus behavior has been devised that uses a combination of a theory for meniscus curvature in rods together with the toroidal approximation of Purcell. The results of the theory show that converging-diverging geometry tends to compensate for the effect of contact angle. This is because the position at which the nonzero contact angle meniscus has maximum curvature in a converging-diverging pore is not the narrowest part of the pore throat. Due to this compensation, the effect of contact angle on maximum meniscus curvatures for drainage is approximately proportional to cos 23 θ (rather than the cos θ appropriate for cylindrical tubes). Experiments on pores formed by PTFE spheres using partially wetting liquids confirmed the theoretical prediction. Contact angle measurements on the PTFE spheres also demonstrated that, because of microscopic surface roughness, receding contact angles (these being operative with respect to drainage) on ground surfaces are significantly lower than values for smooth surfaces.},

Interfaces between fluids of different properties, or “colors,” are represented as transition regions of finite thickness, across which the color variable varies continuously. At each point in the transition region, a force density is defined which is proportional to the curvature of the surface of constant color at that point. It is normalized so that the conventional description of surface tension on an interface is recovered when the ratio of local transition region thickness to local radius of curvature approaches zero. The continuum method eliminates the need for interface reconstruction, simplifies the calculation of surface tension, enables accurate modeling of two- and three-dimensional fluid flows driven by surface forces, and does not impose any modeling restrictions on the number, complexity, or dynamic evolution of fluid interfaces having surface tension. Computational results for two-dimensional flows are given to illustrate the properties of the method.},

To predict multiphase flow through geologically realistic porous media it is necessary to have a three-dimensional (3D) representation of the pore space. Multiple-point statistics were used, based on two-dimensional (2D) thin-sections as training images, to generate 3D pore space representations. The method was borrowed from geostatistical techniques that use pixel-based representations to reproduce large-scale patterns. Thin-section images can provide multiple-point statistics, which describe the statistical relation between multiple spatial locations. Assuming that the medium is isotropic, a 3D image can be generated that preserves typical patterns of the void space seen in the thin sections. The method is tested on Fontainebleau and Berea sandstones for which 3D images from micro-CT scanning are available. The use of multiple-point statistics predicts long-range connectivity of the structures (measured by local percolation probability) better than standard two-point statistics methods. The selection of multiple-point statistics is a key issue and is discussed in detail.},

Finally we study the effects of shape factor, oil/water capillary pressure, and oil/water and gas/oil contact angles on the threshold capillary pressure for gas invasion into oil for spreading and nonspreading systems. In many cases the threshold pressures of the three-phase displacements are not the same as those of the equivalent pseudo-two-phase displacements. It is possible that gas invasion can occur resulting in a configuration without oil layers, even if oil layers are geometrically possible. This emphasizes the distinction between geometric and thermodynamic stability—it is the latter that controls threshold pressures.},

Few capillary pressure/saturation predictive models, however, have been developed or verified for the range of wettability conditions that may be encountered in the natural subsurface. This work presents a new two-phase capillary pressure/saturation model for application to the prediction of primary drainage and imbibition relations in fractional wettability media. This new model is based upon an extension of Leverett scaling theory. Analysis of a series of DNAPL/water experiments, conducted for a number of water/intermediate and water/organic fractional wettability systems, reveals that previous models fail to predict observed behavior. The new Leverett–Cassie model, however, is demonstrated to provide good representations of these data, as well as those from two earlier fractional wettability studies. The Leverett–Cassie model holds promise for field application, based upon its foundation in fundamental scaling principles, its requirement for relatively few and physically based input parameters, and its applicability to a broad range of wetting conditions.},

	abstract = {It is well known that the relationship between capillary pressure and saturation, in two-phase flow problems demonstrates memory effects and, in particular, hysteresis. Explicit representation of full hysteresis with a myriad of scanning curves in models of multiphase flow has been a difficult problem. A second complication relates to the fact that P c–S relationships, determined under static conditions, are not necessarily valid in dynamics. There exist P c–S relationships which take into account dynamic effects. But the combination of hysteretic and dynamic effects in the capillary relationship has not been considered yet. In this paper, we have developed new models of capillary hysteresis which also include dynamic effects. In doing so, thermodynamic considerations are employed to ensure the admissibility of the new relationships. The simplest model is constructed around main imbibition and drainage curves and assumes that all scanning curves are vertical lines. The dynamic effect is taken into account by introducing a damping coefficient in P c–S equation. A second-order model of hysteresis with inclined scanning curves is also developed. The simplest version of proposed models is applied to two-phase incompressible flow and an example problem is solved.},

	abstract = {Understanding the role of thin films in porous media is vital to elucidate wettability at the pore level. The type and thickness of films coating pore walls determine reservoir wettability and whether or not reservoir rock can be altered from its initial state of wettability. Pore shape, especially pore wall curvature, is important in determining wetting-film thicknesses. Yet, pore shape and physics of thin wetting films are generally neglected in flow models in porous rocks. Thin-film forces incorporated into a collection of star-shaped capillary tubes model describe the geological development of mixed wettability in reservoir rock. Here, mixed wettability refers to continuous and distinct oil and water-wetting surfaces coexisting in the porous medium. This model emphasizes the remarkable role of thin films.New pore-level fluid configurations arise that are quite unexpected. For example, efficient water displacement of oil (low residual oil saturation) characteristic of mixed-wettability porous media is ascribed to interconnected oil lenses or rivulets which bridge the walls adjacent to pore corners. Predicted residual oil saturations are approximately 35\% less in mixed-wet rock than in completely water-wet rock. Calculated capillary pressure curves mimic those of mixed-wet porous media in the primary drainage of water, imbibition of water, and secondary drainage modes. Amott-Harvey indices range from −0.18 to 0.36 also in good agreement with experimental values (Morrow et al., 1986; Jadhunandan and Morrow, 1991).},

The bead packing contained planar slabs of mica, quartz, and oxidized silicon wafer, which after flushing and disassembly of the pack allowed analysis of their wettability alteration due to deposition of asphaltenes from the crude oil. These substrates exhibited an overall pattern of rings with clean interiors, matching the brine pendular ring size inferred from experimental and simulated drainage, and asphaltene deposition in their exteriors, verifying the mixed wet model of oil reservoir wettability. The extent of asphaltene intrusion into ring interiors and completeness of asphaltene coverage of exteriors both increased with overall deposition tendency for the brine composition. The observed dependence on NaCl concentration and pH was consistent with expectations from DLVO and non-DLVO interactions governing brine thin film rupture and subsequent asphaltene deposition.},

This paper studies the effect of these forces using a new volume-of-fluid based finite volume method developed for simulating two-phase flow directly on micro-CT images of porous media. An analytical analysis of the relationship between the pore-scale forces and the Darcy-scale pressure drops is presented. We use this analysis to propose unambiguous definitions of Darcy-scale viscous pressure drops as the rate of energy dissipation per unit flow rate of each phase, and then use them to obtain the relative permeability curves. We show that this definition is consistent with conventional laboratory/field measurements by comparing our predictions with experimental relative permeability. We present single and two-phase flow simulations for primary oil injection followed by water injection on a sandpack and a Berea sandstone. The two-phase flow simulations are presented at different capillary numbers which cover the transition from capillary fingering at low capillary numbers to a more viscous fingering displacement pattern at higher capillary numbers, and the effect of capillary number on the relative permeability curves is investigated. Overall, this paper presents a new finite volume-based methodology for the detailed analysis of two-phase flow directly on micro-CT images of porous media and upscaling of the results to the Darcy scale.},

	abstract = {Immiscible displacements in porous media with both capillary and viscous effects can be characterized by two dimensionless numbers, the capillary number C, which is the ratio of viscous forces to capillary forces, and the ratio M of the two viscosities. For certain values of these numbers, either viscous or capillary forces dominate and displacement takes one of the basic forms: (a) viscous fingering, (b) capillary fingering or (c) stable displacement. We present a study in the simple case of injection of a non-wetting fluid into a two-dimensional porous medium made of interconnected capillaries. The first part of this paper presents the results of network simulators (100 × 100 and 25 × 25 pores) based on the physical rules of the displacement at the pore scale. The second part describes a series of experiments performed in transparent etched networks. Both the computer simulations and the experiments cover a range of several decades in C and M. They clearly show the existence of the three basic domains (capillary fingering, viscous fingering and stable displacement) within which the patterns remain unchanged. The domains of validity of the three different basic mechanisms are mapped onto the plane with axes C and M, and this mapping represents the ‘phase-diagram’ for drainage. In the final section we present three statistical models (percolation, diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA) and anti-DLA) which can be used for describing the three ‘basic’ domains of the phase-diagram.},

	abstract = {Pore-network models have been used to describe a wide range of properties from capillary pressure characteristics to interfacial area and mass transfer coefficients. The void space of a rock or soil is described as a network of pores connected by throats. The pores and throats are assigned some idealized geometry and rules are developed to determine the multiphase fluid configurations and transport in these elements. The rules are combined in the network to compute effective transport properties on a mesoscopic scale some tens of pores across. This approach is illustrated by describing a pore-scale model for two- and three-phase flow in media of arbitrary wettability. The appropriate pore-scale physics combined with a geologically representative description of the pore space gives a model that can predict average behavior, such as capillary pressure and relative permeability. This capability is demonstrated by successfully predicting primary drainage and waterflood relative permeabilities for Berea sandstone. The implications of this predictive power for improved characterization of subsurface simulation models are discussed. A simple example field study of waterflooding an oil-wet system near the oil/water contact shows how the assignment of physically-based multiphase flow properties based on pore-scale modeling gives significantly different predictions of oil recovery than using current empirical relative permeability models. Methods to incorporate pore-scale results directly into field-scale simulation are described. In principle, the same approach could be used to describe any type of process for which the behavior is understood at the pore scale.},

Estimates of the residual wetting phase saturation are in accord with previous experiments and predictions on model bead packs. Relative permeabilities computed directly on the digitised images of the fluid phases are in good agreement with experimentally measured values for Berea sandstone. Two simple numerical methods for estimating two phase drainage saturation distributions directly from images are compared. Both methods give good agreement with the bead pack experiment.

Different aspects of the flow phenomenology have been studied, such as bubble creation and transport. As direct numerical methods for tracking interfaces would require too much computation time, especially in three-dimensional cases, we propose to simulate the two-phase flows observed experimentally with two-dimensional simulations corresponding to the spreading of a liquid jet in an array of disks. We show that this numerical approach allows the phenomenology observed experimentally to be reproduced satisfactorily. Hence, numerical simulations can be used subsequently to study the effects of specific parameters without setting up a new experimental procedure. As an example, the stabilizing effect of gas injection on the flow pattern is studied numerically.},

The interface is represented implicitly by the 0.5 level set of a function Φ being a smeared out Heaviside function, i.e., a function being zero on one side of the interface and one on the other. In a transition layer of finite, constant thickness Φ goes smoothly from zero to one. The interface is moved implicitly by the advection of Φ, which is split into two steps. First Φ is advected using a standard numerical method. Then an intermediate step is performed to make sure that the smooth profile of Φ and the thickness of the transition layer is preserved. Both these steps are performed using conservative second order approximations and thus conserving ∫Φ. In this way good conservation of the area bounded by the 0.5 contour of Φ is obtained. Numerical tests shows up to second order accuracy and very good conservation of the area bounded by the interface. The method was also coupled to a Navier–Stokes solver for incompressible two phase flow with surface tension. Results with and without topological changes are presented.},

	abstract = {Pore-scale imaging and modelling – digital core analysis – is becoming a routine service in the oil and gas industry, and has potential applications in contaminant transport and carbon dioxide storage. This paper briefly describes the underlying technology, namely imaging of the pore space of rocks from the nanometre scale upwards, coupled with a suite of different numerical techniques for simulating single and multiphase flow and transport through these images. Three example applications are then described, illustrating the range of scientific problems that can be tackled: dispersion in different rock samples that predicts the anomalous transport behaviour characteristic of highly heterogeneous carbonates; imaging of super-critical carbon dioxide in sandstone to demonstrate the possibility of capillary trapping in geological carbon storage; and the computation of relative permeability for mixed-wet carbonates and implications for oilfield waterflood recovery. The paper concludes by discussing limitations and challenges, including finding representative samples, imaging and simulating flow and transport in pore spaces over many orders of magnitude in size, the determination of wettability, and upscaling to the field scale. We conclude that pore-scale modelling is likely to become more widely applied in the oil industry including assessment of unconventional oil and gas resources. It has the potential to transform our understanding of multiphase flow processes, facilitating more efficient oil and gas recovery, effective contaminant removal and safe carbon dioxide storage.},

The accurate calculation of the interface remains a problem for the volume-of-fluid method if the surface tension force plays an important role and the density ratios of the fluids in different phases are high. The result can be an artificial velocity field at the interface (“parasitic currents”), which can destabilize the interface significantly. The three different algorithms compared can be distinguished by their methods to compute the surface tension force, namely, the method using a kernel function for smoothing the discontinuity at the interface, a combined level-set and volume-of-fluid approach and a parabolic reconstruction of surface tension. The test cases consist of an equilibrium rod, a capillary wave and the Rayleigh–Taylor instability. The analytical solutions for each problem serve to examine the accuracy and the convergence behavior of each approach. Finally, the slow formation of a gas bubble at an underwater orifice was computed with the combined level-set and volume-of-fluid method and the results are compared with an analytical solution based on the Young–Laplace equation.},

Analysis of the Bond, Reynolds, and Capillary numbers for these systems showed that capillary forces were dominant removing the need to model viscous, gravitational, and density effects. A numerical parameterization of the LB model yielded lattice surface tension and contact angle, and appropriate pressure boundary conditions. Two scaling relations provided a link between lattice pressure and physical pressure and lattice time and physical time. Results showed that there was a good match between measured and simulated pressure-saturation data for the water-air system, but that there were large differences between the simulations and observations for the water-Soltrol system. The discrepancies for the water-Soltrol system were probably due to inconsistencies between experimental conditions and simulated conditions such as nonzero contact angle in the experiments. Analysis of saturation profiles indicated increasing saturation near the wetting boundary and decreasing saturations near the nonwetting boundary. We attribute these saturation transitions to pore-neck and percolation effects. While computationally intensive, results of this study were very encouraging for the application of LB simulations to microscale interfacial phenomena. Future studies will carry out a further validation in terms of interfacial areas, contact lines, and fluid distributions.},

We compute the trapped hydrocarbon saturation for tertiary water-flooding, which is water injection into different initial gas saturations, Sgi, established by secondary gas injection after primary drainage. Tertiary water-flooding is continued until all the gas and oil is trapped. We study four different wettability conditions: water-wet, weakly water-wet, weakly oil-wet and oil-wet. We demonstrate that the amounts of oil and gas that are trapped show surprising trends with wettability that cannot be captured using previously developed empirical trapping models. We show that the amount of oil that is trapped by water in the presence of gas increases as the medium becomes more oil-wet, which is opposite from that seen for two-phase flow. It is only through a careful analysis of displacement statistics and fluid configurations that these results can be explained. This illustrates the need to have detailed models of the displacement processes that represent the three-phase displacement physics as carefully as possible. Further work is needed to explore the full range of behavior as a function of wettability and displacement path.},

	abstract = {Capillary condensation of water from undersaturated nonpolar liquids occurs around curved mica surfaces in contact. The capillary-condensed annulus of water leads to a large adhesion between the mica surfaces and the measured pull-off force agrees to within 5\% with the force given by the Young-Laplace equation for the oil/water interface for water activities from ∼ 1 (saturation) down to 0.75. This indicates that the oil/water interfacial tension has its bulk value for menisci with a radii of curvature as low as 2 nm and vindicates the use of the Laplace pressure equation for such small radii. The results further show that, as for liquid/vapor systems, the adhesion force is independent of surface deformations and there is evidence of a solid-solid contribution to the adhesion force, showing up through an effect on the position from which the surfaces come apart. There are, however, systematic deviations from the Kelvin equation for liquid/liquid systems due to the presence of solute, probably from the mica surface, in the condensed annuli. At water activities above 0.8 the oscillatory solvation force found in dry nonpolar liquids is replaced by an attractive force that is observed to “switch on” at some critical distance. A possible explanation is the spontaneous formation of water bridges before the surfaces come into contact. Capillary condensation is also observed in several other systems of incompletely miscible liquids.},

Despite this fact, mathematical descriptions of these flows have been lacking in rigor, consisting primarily of heuristic extensions of Darcy's law that include a hysteretic relation between capillary pressure and saturation and a relative permeability coefficient. As a result, the standard capillary pressure concept appears to have physically unrealistic properties. The present paper employs microscopic mass and momentum balance equations for phases and interfaces to develop an understanding of capillary pressure at the microscale. Next, the standard theories and approaches that define capillary pressure at the macroscale are described and their shortcomings are discussed. Finally, an approach is presented whereby capillary pressure is shown to be an intrinsic property of the system under study. In particular, the presence of interfaces and their distribution within a multiphase system are shown to be essential to describing the state of the system. A thermodynamic approach to the definition of capillary pressure provides a theoretically sound alternative to the definition of capillary pressure as a simple hysteretic function of saturation.},

We report on three dimensional (3D) pore scale medium characterization, absolute permeability computations for throat structures, and pore scale residual fluid distribution in a Berea core. X-ray computed microtomography combined with X-ray attenuating dopants is used to obtain 3D images of the pore network and to resolve phase distributions in the pore space. We present results on pore characterization, including distributions for pore volume, pore surface area, throat surface area, and principal direction diameters for pores and throats. Lattice Boltzmann computations are used to predict absolute permeabilities for individual throats reconstructed from the images. We present results on oil and water distribution in the pore space at residual conditions. We also consider the effects on residual fluid distribution due to the injection and gelation of a water-based gel. In extensive studies of Berea cores it has been observed that introducing water-based gels in the displacement process reduces permeability to water more than to oil. Our results provide supporting evidence for the involvement of gel compaction (dehydration) and oil trapping, while discounting gel blockage in throats, as mechanisms contributing to this effect.},

It is shown that on the pore-scale the fluids may adopt one of three basic configurations depending on the values of the three interfacial tensions and the wetting preference of the solid. The nature of the three-phase displacement mechanisms is determined by the pore-scale fluid distribution. The displacing phase may advance by two basic mechanisms; a double drainage mechanism involving all three phases — a three-phase displacement — or, a direct drainage mechanism — a two-phase displacement. The three-phase displacement mechanism is described by a simple generalisation of two-phase flow mechanisms. The basic displacement mechanisms are incorporated into a numerical percolation-type network model which is used to compute phase recoveries for three-phase displacements. Computed recoveries are shown to be in good agreement with those determined experimentally. The model may therefore provide a basis for modelling three-phase flows in actual porous media.},

	abstract = {The thermodynamic properties of liquids trapped in microscopic pores are described in theory by the Kelvin equation, which relates the equilibrium meniscus curvature to the relative vapor pressure. We report here two series of experiments designed to test the validity of the Kelvin equation by direct measurement of the mean radius of curvature of the surface of cyclohexane condensed between crossed mica cylinders. In one series of experiments, the relative vapor pressure of the volatile cyclohexane was controlled by mixing it with a relatively involatile solute (n-dodecane or n-hexadecane). We found that the mean radius of curvature rapidly reached that predicted by the Kelvin equation at each relative vapor pressure of the volatile liquid, but that there was also a slow, but continuous, accumulation of the “involatile” solute at the point of condensation as the system approached true equilibrium. Such accumulation of very low vapor pressure materials may be one factor responsible for the discordant results reported by earlier workers. We find that the process of impurity buildup is complex, and suggest that studies of real porous systems may be affected by accumulation of “involatile” impurities through the vapor phase and by surface diffusion. The other series of experiments was designed to eliminate the impurity problem by maintaining the vapor pressure by temperature control of the pure liquid. The results from this series of experiments were not time dependent, and no evidence of contamination was found. The measured radii were within ±6\% of those predicted by the Kelvin equation, for radii in the range 4–20 nm. We conclude that the thermodynamic basis of the Kelvin equation is valid in principle for menisci with radii as low as 4 nm.},

	abstract = {We investigate the effect of different saturation histories relevant to various oil displacement processes (including secondary and tertiary gas injections) on three-phase gas/oil/brine relative permeabilities of water-wet sandstone. It is found that three-phase water (wetting phase) relative permeability is primarily a function of water saturation and shows no dependency upon saturation history. Three-phase gas (nonwetting phase) relative permeability is also a function of gas saturation as well as the direction of gas saturation change. Three-phase relative permeability to oil (intermediate-wetting phase) appears to depend on all phase saturations, and saturation history have no significant impact on it. Three-phase oil relative permeability shows weak sensitivity to initial oil saturation prior to gas injection. The functional forms of oil relative permeability with saturation, particularly at low oil saturations, are also examined. It is observed that, at high oil saturations where networks of oil-filled elements govern oil flow, oil relative permeability exhibits a quartic form with oil saturation 
(kro∝So4) whereas, at low oil saturations where flow is believed to be controlled by layer drainage, it shows a quadratic form
(kro∝So2). The quadratic form of three-phase oil relative permeability is consistent with the theoretical interpretation of layer drainage at the pore scale.},

The permeability and conductivity are determined by solving numerically the local equations governing the transport. The reconstructed microstructure is transformed into a topologically equivalent network that is used directly as input to a network model. Computed two-phase and three-phase relative permeabilities for water wet conditions are in good agreement with experimental data. We present a method for characterizing wettability on the pore-scale from measured Amott wettability indices. Simulated effects of wettability on waterflood relative permeabilities and oil recovery compare favourably with experimental results.},

However, a quantitative and explicit characterization, by means of a physical interpretation, is difficult because of the geometric complexity of soil structure.Pores larger than 40 μm within two soil horizons have been analysed morphologically on 3-dimensional digital representations of the pore space obtained by serial sections through impregnated specimens. The Euler-Poincaré characteristic has been determined as an index of connectivity in three dimensions. The pore connectivity is quantified as a function of the minimum pore diameter considered leading to a connectivity function of the pore space. Different pore size classes were distinguished using 3-dimensional erosion and dilation. The connectivity function turned out to differentiate between two soil materials. The pore space in an upper Ah horizon is intensely connected through pores between 40 and 100 μm, in contrast to the pore space in the AhBv beneath it. The morphological pore-size distributions were compared to the pore-size distribution obtained by water retention measurements. The discrepancy between these different methods corresponds to the expectation due to pore connectivity.},

We use the set of ideal two-phase systems to validate the approach and provide parameter information, which we then use to simulate a sphere-pack system. The sphere-pack system is designed to mimic laboratory experiments conducted to evaluate the hysteretic capillary pressure saturation relation for a system consisting of water, tetrachloroethylene, and a glass bead porous medium. Good agreement is achieved between the measured hysteretic capillary pressure saturation relations and the LB simulations when comparing entry pressure, displacement slopes, irreducible saturation, and residual entrapment. Our results further show that while qualitatively similar results are obtained when comparing systems consisting of 1200 spheres and 150 spheres, there is a significant difference between these two levels, suggesting a lower bound on the size of a representative elementary volume.},

Our goal is not to predict the outcome of core floods, but rather to perform a sensitivity analysis of the above-mentioned parameters, except from the viscosity ratio. We find that contact angle, aspect ratio, and capillary number all have a significant influence on the competition between piston-like advance, leading to high recovery, and snap-off, causing oil entrapment. Due to significant CPU-time requirements we did not incorporate long-range correlations among pore and throat sizes in our network, but were limited to small-range correlations. Consequently, the gradual suppression of snap-off occurs within one order of magnitude of the capillary number. At capillary numbers around 108 - 107 snap-off has been entirely inhibited, in agreement with results obtained by Blunt (1997) who used a quasi-static model. For higher aspect ratios, the effect of rate and contact angle is more pronounced.},

In contrast, the invasion-percolation model of drainage with trapping does not make a sensible prediction for the relative permeability of either the displaced or injected phases since it fails to represent the fluid connectivity correctly. We describe two realistic trapping mechanisms which overcome this difficulty by representing the flow of the wetting phase along irregularities in the pore-gain surface. In imbibition, we simulate the rate-dependent competition between bulk filling of pores and film flow and show how different displacement mechanisms affect relative permeability. We verify percolation-theory results for the effects of buoyancy forces on trapped saturation by simulation and derive an expression for the correlation length in displacements perturbed by viscous forces. We can then demonstrate how relative permeabilities measured in quasistatic systems at capillary equilibrium are still meaningful in larger-scale displacements where viscous forces predominate.},

	title = {Mechanistic study of menisci motion within homogeneously and heterogeneously wet porous media},
	url = {https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/6568},
	abstract = {Oil reservoirs and soil can be homogeneously wet (water-wet, oil-wet, neutralwet)
or heterogeneously wet (mixed wet or fractionally wet). The goal of this research is
to model the detailed configuration of wetting and non-wetting phases within
homogeneously and heterogeneously wet porous media. We use a dense random pack of
equal spheres as a model porous medium. The geometry of the sphere pack is complex
but it is known.
In homogeneously wet porous media we quantify the effect of low saturations of
the wetting phase on the non-wetting phase relative permeability by solving analytically
the geometry of the wetting phase. At low saturations (at or near the drainage endpoint)
the wetting phase exists largely in the form of pendular rings held at grain contacts. Pore
throats correspond to the constriction between groups of three grains, each pair of which
can be in contact. Thus the existence of these pendular rings decreases the void area available for the flowing non-wetting phase. Consequently, the existence of the pendular
rings decreases the permeability of non-wetting phase. Our model explains the significant
permeability reduction of the non-wetting phase with a small change in the wetting phase
in a low permeability porous medium.
To model heterogeneously wet porous medium, we assume that the porous
medium is fractionally wet where each grain is either oil-wet or water-wet. These waterwet
or oil-wet grains are distributed randomly within the porous medium. We calculate
analytically the stable fluid configuration in individual pores and throats of a fractionally
wet medium. The calculation is made tractable by idealizing the configurations as locally
spherical (menisci) or toroidal (pendular rings.) Because the calculation of the interface
position is entirely local and grain-based, it provides a single, generalized, geometric
basis for computing pore-filling events during drainage as well as imbibition. This
generality is essential for modeling displacements in fractionally wet media. Pore filling
occurs when an interface becomes unstable in a pore throat (analogous to the Haines
condition for drainage in a uniformly wet throat), when two or more interfaces come into
contact and merge to form a single interface (analogous to the Melrose condition for
imbibition in uniformly wet medium), or when a meniscus in a throat touches a nearby
grain (a new stability criterion).  The concept of tracking the fluid/fluid interfaces on each grain means that a
traditional pore network is not used in the model. The calculation of phase saturation or
other quantities that are conveniently computed in a network can be done with any
approach for defining pore bodies and throats. The fluid/fluid interfaces are mapped from
the grain-based model to the network as needed. Consequently, the model is robust as
there is no difference in the model between drainage and imbibition, as all criteria are
accounted for both increasing and decreasing capillary pressure.},

Free energy balance for three fluid phases in a capillary of arbitrarily shaped cross-section: capillary entry pressures and layers of the intermediate-wetting phase. J Colloid Interf Sci 2004;277:184–201], we investigate for a single pore of uniform but arbitrary wettability the consistency of the relation between the pressure combinations and the pore phase occupancies in a three-phase system. The solutions of this equation corresponding to all possible displacements arising in three-phase flow are plotted in a single graph for two of the radii of curvature, which are equivalent to the phase pressure combinations. Consequently, this graph presents a delineation of the radius (pressure) space corresponding to different pore phase occupancies and we show that the underlying pressure–occupancy relation is unique using a free energy argument. The relation is presented for two very different parameter combinations. We explore how it can be extended when additional restrictions apply, for example those arising from lack of phase availability in an interconnected network. Using a capillary bundle of pores with triangular cross-section, we show the consequences for three-phase displacement processes if capillary entry pressures are and are not chosen consistently, the latter being common practice in all current three-phase pore network models. Displacements in both a water-wet and in a mixed-wet system are studied. The main conclusions from this work are that for a single pore different parameter combinations may lead to very different, but unique, pressure–occupancy relations. The saturation paths resulting from three-phase flow calculations in a capillary bundle of triangular pores are often significantly different using the true three-phase conditions as opposed to using inconsistent (two-phase) conditions, in particular in a mixed-wet system. Such large differences may also occur in interconnected pore network models, but only when continuity of the phases is high. The results indicate that, when the true conditions are used, there exists also a unique relation between the pressure combinations and the (bulk) occupancies in a bundle of pores with non-circular cross-section, similar to the relation for a bundle of cylindrical pores.},

Also, the water-advancing angle may have values that range from 50° to 180°. This investigation uses atomic force microscopy (AFM) to characterize mica surfaces that have first been equilibrated in 0.01 M NaCl, pH 6 brine and then aged in crude oil at elevated temperature. The wettability of the aged surfaces was measured with brine and crude oil. The mica surfaces that were to be examined by AFM were washed with cyclohexane to remove the bulk crude oil. The wettability of the surfaces washed with cyclohexane was measured with brine and decane. Two crude oils were used in this investigation. They were either used as the stock tank oil (STO) or diluted to 40\% with n-heptane. This particular dilution was used because it is close to the asphaltene precipitation point of one of the crude oils. The AFM images show the mixed-wet surface to be patches of bare mica and patches of asphaltene with a characteristic areal dimension of about 200 nm. The elevations of the asphaltene patches are about 20 nm for the STOs but increase to above 200 nm when the crude oil is diluted to 40\% with n-heptane. These mica surfaces equilibrated with crude oil diluted with heptane have larger advancing contact angles (e.g., 140°) compared to the surfaces equilibrated with STO (e.g., 75°). From this, we infer that the advancing contact angle becomes larger as the asphaltene solvency decreases because of increased coverage of the mica surface with larger asphaltene aggregates.},

The wettability of the chalk was evaluated by their ability to spontaneously imbibe synthetic brine. There was no sign of water imbibition into cores without initial water saturation after 5 weeks, while cores with an initial water saturation of 23\% imbibed about 9\% of water during 8 weeks at 40°C.},

	abstract = {The present work incorporates the effects of interface dynamics into the theoretical description of two-phase flow in a porous medium. This advance offers the potential for improved understanding and modeling of multiphase flow processes. To provide background for this work, the traditional approach to describing two-phase flow in porous media is reviewed. The universally employed empirical extension of Darcy's Law for single-phase flow to two-phase flow situations is rejected as arbitrary and subject to severe shortcomings. Burial of dynamic effects into relative permeability and capillary pressure hysteresis is shown to be an unsatisfactory theoretical construct for modeling the actual processes occurring in two-phase flow. Examination of the traditional theory at equilibrium shows that interfacial forces actually present in multiphase systems have been overlooked causing the theory to provide contradictory results. To overcome these problems, a general theory of two-phase flow is proposed that is based on the basic principles of mass, momentum, and energy conservation and the second law of thermodynamics. This theory accounts, in a systematic way, for interfacial forces that are known to have an important effect on the movement of fluid phases in a porous medium. A new equation of momentum balance accounting for the presence of interfaces and their energetics is developed. This equation reduces to Darcy's Law for the special case of single-phase flow. The extended theory has the potential to describe phenomena unaccounted for by the traditional theory and thus provides a basis for scientific understanding of the physics of two-phase flow. Application of the theory requires experimental study to ascertain the values and precise functional dependence of the constitutive coefficients that arise.},

Classical hydrodynamics is largely concerned with perfect fluids which unfortunately exert no forces on the particles past which they move. Practical approaches to subjects like fluidization, sedimentation, and flow through porous media abound in much useful but uncorrelated empirical information. The present book represents an attempt to bridge this gap by providing at least the beginnings of a rational approach to fluid particle dynamics, based on first principles. From the pedagogic viewpoint it seems worthwhile to show that the Navier-Stokes equations, which form the basis of all systematic texts, can be employed for useful practical applications beyond the elementary problems of laminar flow in pipes and Stokes law for the motion of a single particle. Although a suspension may often be viewed as a continuum for practical purposes, it really consists of a discrete collection of particles immersed in an essentially continuous fluid. Consideration of the actual detailed boundary value problems posed by this viewpoint may serve to call attention to the limitation of idealizations which apply to the overall transport properties of a mixture of fluid and solid particles.},

	abstract = {Pore-scale modeling of three-phase capillary pressure in realistic pore geometries could contribute to an increased knowledge of three-phase displacement mechanisms and also provide support to time-consuming and challenging core-scale laboratory measurements. In this work we have developed a semi-analytical model for computing three-phase capillary pressure curves and the corresponding three-phase fluid configurations in uniformly-wet rock images encountered during tertiary gas invasion. The fluid configurations and favorable entry pressure are determined based on free energy minimization by combining all physically allowed gas-oil, gas-water, and oil-water arc menisci in various ways. The model is shown to reproduce all threephase displacements and capillary entry pressures that previously have been derived in idealized angular tubes for gas invasion at uniform water-wet conditions. These single-pore displacement mechanisms include (i) gas invasion into pores occupied by oil and water leading to simultaneous displacement of the three fluids, (ii) simultaneous invasion of bulk gas and surrounding oil into water filled pores, and finally (iii) the pure two-phase fluid displacements in which gas invades pores occupied by either water or oil. The proposed novel semi-analytical model is validated against existing analytical solutions developed in a star-shape pore space, and subsequently employed on an SEM image of Bentheim sandstone to simulate three-phase fluid configurations and capillary pressure curves at uniform water-wet conditions and different spreading coefficents. The simulated fluid configurations for the different spreading coefficients show similar oil layer behaviour as previously published experimental three-phase fluid configurations obtained by computed microtomography in Bentheim sandstone. The computed saturation paths indicate that three-phase oil-water capillary pressure is a function of the water saturation only, whereas the three-phase gas-oil capillary pressure appears to be a function of two saturations. This is explained by the three-phase displacements occurring in the majority of the simulations, in which gas-water interfaces form immediately during gas invasion into oil- and water-saturated pore shapes.},

The hydrodynamic system of equations (local conservation laws for chemical components, momentum, and energy) is used to describe multiphase processes, and the constitutive relations (expressions for stresses, diffusion, and heat fluxes) are derived from entropy growth requirement.

In practice, however, network models have been constructed using various assumptions concerning pore structure. This paper presents a network model of a real, disordered porous medium that invokes no assumptions regarding pore structure. The calculated permeability of the model agrees well with measured permeabilities, providing a new and more rigorous confirmation of the validity of the network approach. Several assumptions commonly used in constructing network models are found to be invalid for a random packing of equal spheres. In addition, the model permits quantification of the effect of pore-scale correlation (departure from randomness) upon permeability. The effect is comparable to reported discrepancies between measured permeabilities and predictions of other network models. The implications of this finding are twofold. First, a key assumption of several theories of transport in porous media, namely that pore dimensions are randomly distributed upon a network, may be invalid for real porous systems. Second, efforts both to model and to measure pore-scale correlations could yield more accurate predictions of permeability.},

	abstract = {We have developed a new approach for generating pore throat cross sections of various shapes based on distributions of shape factors and radii of inscribed circles. These distributions are obtained from analysis of grains packing. General formulas for calculating geometrical properties and entry capillary pressure for given shape factor and inscribed circle radius are developed. These relationships are employed in a pore network, which has a number of special features. In particular, it is highly flexible in terms of location of pore bodies, variable coordination number, as well as variable cross-sectional shapes. The pore network model is employed for simulating the equilibrium distribution of two fluids in a granular porous medium, under both drainage and imbibition conditions. The pore network model is verified by comparing simulation results with experimental data of quasi-static drainage and imbibition experiments in a glass bead medium. The pore-level topology and geometrical description of pore bodies and pore throats, essential for building the network, are rigorously extracted from experimental data using image analysis (3DMA-Rock software). Calculated capillary pressure-saturation (Pc − Sw) and specific interfacial area-saturation (anw − Sw) curves show very good agreement with measured ones, for both drainage and imbibition. We show that the shape factor can significantly influence the form of macroscopic Pc − Sw and anw − Sw curves, if the length and volumes associated to the pore throats are considerable. Furthermore, using continuous generation of shape factor distribution, the model can be validated against the grain size distribution. After validating the model against experiments, in addition to primary and main curves, we simulate many scanning curves to generate Pc − Sw − anw surfaces for drainage and imbibition, separately. Results show that these two surfaces lie very close to each other, and the average normalized difference is small, in the range of simulations uncertainty. Our results illustrate that Pc − Sw − anw surfaces show very little hysteresis and, therefore, specific interfacial area can be considered as an essential variable for reducing or eliminating the hysteresis observed in Pc − Sw curves.},

While the present two-dimensional mathematical model is a free boundary problem, in our new numerical method, the fluid domain enclosed by the free boundary is embedded into a rectangular one so that the problem can be solved by a regular Cartesian grid method. We introduce an augmented variable along the free boundary so that the stress balancing boundary condition is satisfied. A hybrid time discretization is used in the projection method for better stability. The resultant Helmholtz/Poisson equations with interfaces then are solved by the IIM in an efficient way. Several numerical tests including an accuracy check, and the spreading and recoiling processes of a liquid drop are presented in detail.},

	abstract = {As gas flooding becomes a more viable means of enhanced oil recovery, it is important to identify and understand the pore-scale flow mechanisms, both for the development of improved gas flooding applications and for the predicting phase mobilisation under secondary and tertiary gas flooding. The purpose of this study was to visually investigate the pore-level mechanisms of oil recovery by near-miscible secondary and tertiary gas floods. High-pressure glass micromodels and model fluids representing a near-miscible fluid system were used for the flow experiments. A new pore-scale recovery mechanism was identified which significantly contributed to oil recovery through enhanced flow and cross-flow between the bypassed pores and the injected gas. This mechanism is strongly related to a very low gas/oil interfacial tension (IFT), perfect wetting conditions and simultaneous flow of gas and oil in the same pore, all of which occur as the gas/oil critical point is approached. The results of this study helps us to better understand the pore-scale mechanisms of oil recovery in very low-IFT (near-miscible) systems. In particular we show that in near-miscible gas floods, behind the main gas front, the recovery of the oil continues by cross-flow from the bypassed pores into the main flow stream and as a result almost all of the oil, which has been contacted by the gas, could be recovered. Our observations in high-pressure micromodel experiments have demonstrated that this mechanism can only occur in near-miscible processes (as opposed to immiscible and completely miscible processes), which makes oil displacement by near-miscible gas floods a very effective process.},

	abstract = {The performance of the open source multiphase flow solver, interFoam, is evaluated in this work. The solver is based on a modified volume of fluid (VoF) approach, which incorporates an interfacial compression flux term to mitigate the effects of numerical smearing of the interface. It forms a part of the C + + libraries and utilities of OpenFOAM and is gaining popularity in the multiphase flow research community. However, to the best of our knowledge, the evaluation of this solver is confined to the validation tests of specific interest to the users of the code and the extent of its applicability to a wide range of multiphase flow situations remains to be explored. In this work, we have performed a thorough investigation of the solver performance using a variety of verification and validation test cases, which include (i) verification tests for pure advection (kinematics), (ii) dynamics in the high Weber number limit and (iii) dynamics of surface tension-dominated flows. With respect to (i), the kinematics tests show that the performance of interFoam is generally comparable with the recent algebraic VoF algorithms; however, it is noticeably worse than the geometric reconstruction schemes. For (ii), the simulations of inertia-dominated flows with large density ratios yielded excellent agreement with analytical and experimental results. In regime (iii), where surface tension is important, consistency of pressure–surface tension formulation and accuracy of curvature are important, as established by Francois et al (2006 J. Comput. Phys. 213 141–73). Several verification tests were performed along these lines and the main findings are: (a) the algorithm of interFoam ensures a consistent formulation of pressure and surface tension; (b) the curvatures computed by the solver converge to a value slightly (10\%) different from the analytical value and a scope for improvement exists in this respect. To reduce the disruptive effects of spurious currents, we followed the analysis of Galusinski and Vigneaux (2008 J. Comput. Phys. 227 6140–64) and arrived at the following criterion for stable capillary simulations for interFoam: where . Finally, some capillary flows relevant to atomization were simulated, resulting in good agreement with the results from the literature.},

	abstract = {A boundary condition of a two-phase lattice Boltzmann (LB) method is proposed to model smooth substrates of chemically heterogeneous surfaces. The present technique is applied to the LB simulations of liquid drops on homogeneous, regularly heterogeneous, and randomly heterogeneous surfaces. It is found (i) that the LB technique can mimic not only homogeneous substrates with arbitrary wettabilities but also chemically heterogeneous substrates with arbitrary heterogeneities and wettabilities and (ii) that, in the presence of surface heterogeneities, it also can capture the contact line pinning, the contact angle hysteresis, and the effects of size and distribution of the heterogeneities on them. The results indicate that the present LB method is useful for the simulation of wetting phenomena of chemically heterogeneous surfaces.},

This displacement may arise in combination with a piston-like displacement in which the layers are formed, or, alternatively, these two displacements do not occur and a single piston-like displacement arises removing all oil from the pore cross-section at once. The free energy differentials associated with the three displacements determine exactly which displacement(s) happen during water invasion. Depending on the area and the (advancing) contact angle on the surface of altered wettability, as well as on the half-angles of the pore corners, layers may or may not exist. We compare the criterion for the displacement of oil layers with the existing geometrical criterion. The latter always allows a larger range of contact angles and pressure combination for which layers may exist than the presently derived criterion, hence the geometrical criterion is insufficient and is now superceded.},

An MRI visualization of the 3-D packing of spheres for which NMR data are obtained is used as the matrix for the simulation, thereby enabling a direct assessment of the ability of the lattice-Boltzmann method to quantitatively predict flow phenomena within porous media of complex geometry. By introducing normalized parameters, hydrodynamical dispersion over normalized displacement lengthscales extending over nearly four orders of magnitude is investigated and is shown to be dominated by mechanical dispersion over most of this range. At the largest lengthscales studied holdup may play a significant role in the hydrodynamics characteristic of the porous medium. Quantitative agreement between NMR measurements and the predictions of the lattice-Boltzmann simulation is obtained in all cases.},

	abstract = {Experiments were performed on transparent two-dimensional microfluidic porous systems to investigate the relationships among capillary pressure and the interfacial areas per volume between two fluid phases and one solid phase. Capillary pressures were calculated from the observed interfacial curvature of the wetting-nonwetting interface, and these correlated closely to externally measured values of applied pressure. For each applied pressure, the system established mechanical equilibrium characterized by stationary interfaces, uniform curvatures across the model, and random surface normals. To study the relationships among capillary pressure and the interfacial areas, we compare the curvature-based capillary pressure with the differential change in interfacial areas per volume as a function of wetting-phase saturation. The differential pressure contributions calculated from the experimental measurements are found to be nearly independent of the measured capillary pressure. These results suggest that other contributions to the capillary pressure must be significant when imbibition and drainage processes result in saturation gradients.},

This article reviews recent developments in the statistical theory and computer simulation of simple fluids confined in model pores, emphasizing the microscopic structure and phase equilibria. The structure reflects the packing of atoms or molecules in confining geometries while the phase behavior reflects the presence of surface and bulk contributions to the fluid's free energy. Confinement shifts first-order transitions, such as condensation or freezing, away from their location in bulk; it also alters the location and nature of the bulk critical point reducing the effective dimensionality. Sometimes surface phase transitions such as layering and prewetting compete with shifted bulk transitions giving rise to rich phase diagrams. The extent to which the theorists' results for fluids in single idealized pores might be relevant for solvation force studies probing liquids between crossed mica cylinders and for gas adsorption studies in real mesoporous solids such as VYCOR is mentioned briefly.},

The invasion mechanism is analyzed quantitatively for partial and total wetting conditions, and for various stable viscosity ratios and capillary pressure heterogeneity. For capillary numbers ranging from 10−7 to 10−2, we observe a transition between capillary fingering and a stable front. The capillary fingering regime exhibits differences between partial and complete wetting systems: The front width in complete wetting is larger. Simple models are proposed to account for these regimes and indicate that the differences between the systems are likely to be due to the flow of the displaced fluid in the complete wetting situation.},

	abstract = {We present a level set method for simulating capillary-controlled displacements with nonzero contact angles in porous media. The main feature of the method is a level set evolution velocity which is different in the pore space and solid phase. This augments the standard level set equation with an extra term such that, at steady state, the contact angle is enforced in the solid phase, whereas capillary and interfacial forces are balanced in the pore space. We employ the method to simulate quasistatic drainage and imbibition processes for different contact angles in several pore geometries, and to compute capillary pressure and fluid/fluid specific interfacial area curves in each case. We validate the method by comparing stable fluid configurations computed in idealized two-dimensional geometries and three-dimensional (3-D) straight tubes with known analytical solutions. Simulations performed in a subset of a 3-D sandstone image show that the developed method accounts for well-known pore-scale mechanisms such as piston-like invasion, Haines jump, interface coalescence, and retraction, swelling of wetting films and snap-off. The contact angle is formed by an intersection of the fluid/fluid interface and the void/solid boundary. Therefore, the solid matrix surrounding the pore space is discretized with at least an equal number of grid points as the size of the numerical stencil used to approximate the level set derivatives.},

	abstract = {During the last 2.5 years, the RealityGrid project has allowed us to be one of the few scientific groups involved in the development of computational Grids. Since smoothly working production Grids are not yet available, we have been able to substantially influence the direction of software and Grid deployment within the project. In this paper, we review our results from large-scale three-dimensional lattice Boltzmann simulations performed over the last 2.5 years. We describe how the proactive use of computational steering, and advanced job migration and visualization techniques enabled us to do our scientific work more efficiently. The projects reported on in this paper are studies of complex fluid flows under shear or in porous media, as well as large-scale parameter searches, and studies of the self-organization of liquid cubic mesophases.},

We use quadtree and octree data structures to represent the grid and a simple algorithm to generate a mesh with the finest resolution at the interface. In particular, we present (1) a locally third order accurate reinitialization scheme that transforms an arbitrary level set function into a signed distance function, (2) a second order accurate semi-Lagrangian methods to evolve the linear level set advection equation under an externally generated velocity field, (3) a second order accurate upwind method to evolve the non-linear level set equation under a normal velocity as well as to extrapolate scalar quantities across an interface in the normal direction, and (4) a semi-implicit scheme to evolve the interface under mean curvature. Combined, we obtain a level set method on adaptive Cartesian grids with a negligible amount of mass loss. We propose numerical examples in two and three spatial dimensions to demonstrate the accuracy of the method.},

	abstract = {Theoretical and computational aspects of the method of interfacial dynamics for flow at vanishing Reynolds number are considered. The mathematical formulation relies on the boundary-integral representation that expresses the flow in terms of distributions of Stokes-flow singularities over the interfaces. The densities of the distributions are identified with the jump in the hydrodynamic traction due to interfacial in-plane and transverse tensions, the interfacial velocity, or the strength of a hydrodynamic potential. The numerical procedure involves describing the interfaces in terms of interfacial marker points that reproduce the evolving shapes of the interfaces by global or local interpolation; solving integral equations of the second kind for the interfacial velocity or for the density of a hydrodynamic potential; and computing the motion of the marker points while simultaneously updating interfacial fields relevant to the dynamics, including the concentration of a surfactant and the position of interfacial point particles at an equilibrium configuration. Interfaces exhibiting isotropic tension, elastic tensions, viscous, and incompressible behavior are considered. The mathematical modeling of the tensions and bending moments developing over interfaces with a membrane-like constitution is discussed in the context of the theory of thin shells. To facilitate the numerical implementation, the coupling of the interfacial mechanics to the hydrodynamics by means of interface force and torque balances is formulated in global Cartesian coordinates. Recent progress in the implementation of boundary-element methods is reviewed, and areas for further research are identified.},

	abstract = {This paper provides the tools needed for analysis of multiphase flow in porous media. Contributions are in four areas. First, theorems are provided that allow global scale integral equations to be localized at the porous medium scale. This is a more general approach than the traditional averaging of microscale point equations. Second, conservation equations for mass, momentum, energy and entropy for phases, interfaces, common lines, and common points are obtained. The inclusion of common lines and common points completes the full description of multiphase flow in porous media. Third, the entropy inequality is developed for the full multiphase system. The interaction terms between phases, interfaces, common lines, and common points provide a clear direction as to whether the entropy equation for each of these components may be used in the development of a constitutive theory or if the constitutive theory will depend on a combined entropy inequality statement. Fourth, the simplification of the system of equations is presented for the case of massless interfaces and common lines where these constituents are still capable of sustaining stress and containing energy. These latter forms are particularly useful in consideration of capillary pressure terms when the mass of the interface may be considered negligible.},

This allows for close observation of the drainage and imbibition processes, assessment of equilibrium states, and studying the effects of fluid phase disconnection and reconnection on the resulting capillary pressures and interfacial curvatures. Based on this analysis estimates of capillary pressure calculated from interfacial curvature can be compared to capillary pressure measured externally with a transducer. Results show good agreement between curvature-based and transducer-based measurements when connected phase interfaces are considered. Curvature measurements show a strong dependence on whether an interface is formed by connected or disconnected fluid and the time allowed for equilibration. The favorable agreement between curvature-based and transducer-based capillary pressure measurements shows promise for the use of image-based estimates of capillary pressure for interfaces that cannot be probed with external transducers as well as opportunities for a detailed assessment of interfacial curvature during drainage and imbibition.},

Quantification of the NAPL–water interfacial area provides a measure of the expected area available for mass transfer and will likely be a primary determinant of NAPL removal efficiency. To measure the interfacial area, we have used a synchrotron-based CMT technique to obtain high-resolution 3D images of flow in a Soltrol–water–glass bead system. The interfacial area is found to increase as the wetting phase saturation decreases, reach a maximum, and then decrease as the wetting phase saturation goes to zero. These results are compared to previous findings for an air–water–glass bead study; The Soltrol–water interfacial areas were found to peak at similar saturations as those measured for the air–water system (20–35\% saturation range), however, the peak values were in some cases almost twice as high for the oil-water system. We believe that the observed differences between the air–water and oil–water systems to a large degree can be explained by the differences in interfacial tensions for the two systems.},

	abstract = {In this work we challenge the assumption that the capillary entry pressures for displacements in three-phase flow are the same as those in two-phase flow. Using an energy balance, as derived by R.P. Mayer and R.A. Stowe (J. Colloid Interface Sci. 20 (1965) 893–911) and H.M. Princen (J. Colloid Interface Sci. 30 (1969) 69–75; 30 (1969) 359–371; 34 (1970) 171–184) for two-phase flow, we derive a general formula for determination of the capillary entry pressures for piston-like displacement of two bulk phases in a pore where a third phase may also be present. The method applies to capillaries of angular cross-section and uniform but arbitrary wettability. To use this method we have determined all possible underlying phase occupancies in cross-sections on either side of the main terminal meniscus, in particular the presence of corner arc menisci (AMs). Indeed, the capillary entry pressures for piston-like displacements depend on the pressure in the remaining third phase if the cross-sectional fluid configurations contain this phase. This dependence only vanishes when layers of the intermediate-wetting phase completely separate the wetting and the non-wetting phases. The complexity of the corresponding equations and the quantitative effects are studied using two different geometries, the equilateral triangle and the rhombus. The main difference is that the latter geometry has unequal corners, which may carry different AMs. We have carried out a limited sensitivity study with respect to the effect of wettability, the spreading coefficient of the intermediate-wetting phase, and the aspect ratio of the principal radii of the rhombus.},

A combination of standard SPH equations with pairwise fluid-fluid and fluid-solid particle-particle interactions allowed surface tension and three-phase contact dynamics to be simulated. The model was validated by calculating the surface tension in four different ways: (i) from small-amplitude oscillations of fluid drops, (ii) from the dependence of the capillary pressure on drop radius, (iii) from capillary rise simulations, and (iv) from the behavior of a fluid drop confined between parallel walls under the influence of gravity. All four simulations led to consistent values for the surface tension. The dependence of receding and advancing contact angles on droplet velocity was studied. Incorporation of surface tension and fluid-solid interactions allowed unsaturated flow through fracture junctions to be realistically simulated, and the simulation results compare well with the laboratory experiments of Dragila and Weisbrod.},

	abstract = {Volume-of-fluid (VOF) methods are popular for the direct numerical simulation of time-dependent viscous incompressible flow of multiple liquids. As in any numerical method, however, it has its weaknesses, namely, for flows in which the capillary force is the dominant physical mechanism. The lack of convergence with spatial refinement, or convergence to a solution that is slightly different from the exact solution, has been documented in the literature. A well-known limiting case for this is the existence of spurious currents for the simulation of a spherical drop with zero initial velocity. These currents are present in all previous versions of VOF algorithms. In this paper, we develop an accurate representation of the body force due to surface tension, which effectively eliminates spurious currents. We call this algorithm PROST: parabolic reconstruction of surface tension. There are several components to this procedure, including the new body force algorithm, improvements in the projection method for the Navier–Stokes solver, and a higher order interface advection scheme. The curvature to the interface is calculated from an optimal fit for a quadratic approximation to the interface over groups of cells.},

The approach combines the level set method of S. Osher and J. A. Sethian with a theoretical variational formulation of the motion by F. Reitich and H. M. Soner. The resulting method uses as many level set functions as there are regions and the energy functional is evaluated entirely in terms of level set functions. The gradient projection method leads to a coupled system of perturbed (by curvature terms) Hamilton–Jacobi equations. The coupling is enforced using a single Lagrange multiplier associated with a constraint which essentially prevents (a) regions from overlapping and (b) the development of a vacuum. The numerical implementation is relatively simple and the results agree with (and go beyond) the theory as given in [12]. Other applications of this methodology, including the decomposition of a domain into subregions with minimal interface length, are discussed. Finally, some new techniques and results in level set methodology are presented.},

	abstract = {Pore-scale processes govern fundamental behavior in multiphase porous media systems. A high-resolution, three-dimensional image of the interior of a multiphase porous media system was obtained using synchrotron X-ray tomography. The system was imaged at a resolution of 12.46 μm following entrapment of the nonwetting phase at residual saturation. First, the physically representative network structure of the porous media system is extracted from the void space. This provides a direct mapping of the pore bodies and throats and enables pore-level calculations of coordination numbers, aspect ratios, and pore body and throat correlations. Next, algorithms developed to calculate properties of the entrapped nonwetting phase, such as volume, sphericity, interfacial area, and orientation, are applied to the residual nonwetting phase blobs. Finally, correlations between the pore network structure and nonwetting phase characteristics are examined. As expected, it was found that the nonwetting phase was trapped primarily in the largest pore spaces, the pore bodies with the highest aspect ratios, and the pore bodies with the highest coordination numbers. This work shows that, while there may be limitations related to the ability to capture REV-sized domains for some of the multiphase flow properties and phenomena, high-resolution X-ray tomography is able to provide the high quality datasets needed to observe and quantify the pore-scale phenomena and processes that govern multiphase flow in unconsolidated porous media systems.},

	abstract = {In this work, a multicomponent lattice Boltzmann (LB) model is presented for simulating reactive transport in porous media at the pore scale. In the model, a set of distribution functions is introduced to simulate fluid flow and solute transport. The model takes into account advection, diffusion, homogeneous reactions among multiple aqueous species, and heterogeneous reactions between the aqueous solution and minerals, as well as changes in solid and pore geometry. Homogeneous reactions are described through local equilibrium mass action relations. Mineral reactions are treated kinetically through boundary conditions at the mineral surface. The LB equation for flow recovers the correct pore-scale continuity and Navier-Stokes equations. The LB equations for solute transport are modified to recover advection-diffusion equations for total concentrations at the pore scale. The model is applied to a hypothetical three-component system with two aqueous complexes and two mineral reactions in a simple pore geometry. The effects of advection, diffusion, reaction rate constants, equilibrium constants of both homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions, and chemical compositions on mineral alteration of the porous medium and solute concentration are analyzed.},

Petrographic Image Analysis (PIA) was developed from the beginning to interface with petrophysical/geophysical data. PIA relies upon computer-based image analysis using pattern recognition/classification programs, and so information can be obtained very rapidly–the rate simply tied to sophistication of the computer in use. PIA consists of a critical mix of hardware and software which perform four separate functions: 1) image acquisition; 2) image digitization; 3) image segmentation; and 4) image analysis. A special effort has been made to characterize the geometry of the pore complex. Separate spectra related to pore size and pore roughness are generated from each image. In addition, surface area per unit volume of pore can be estimated. Pore spectra can be decomposed and classified using pattern recognition/ classification algorithms or used directly to estimate physical parameters.},

We analyze and propose optimal computational settings to obtain a sharp fluid interface and small parasitic currents. To show the usability of our computational rules, numerical simulations are presented for three benchmark cases, viz. the steady motion of bubbles in a straight two-dimensional channel, the formation of bubbles in two- and three-dimensional T-junctions, and the breakup of droplets in three-dimensional T-junctions. An error analysis on the accuracy of the computations is presented to probe the efficacy of the VOF method.

From considerations of capillary equilibrium and an analysis of micromodel experiments, the pore scale displacement mechanisms are described. The stability of layers of NAPL between water and gas has an important impact upon the recovery of NAPL to low saturation. The displacement mechanisms and the effects of NAPL layers are incorporated into a three-dimensional network model. The network model calculates capillary pressure, relative permeability, and NAPL recovery. Several types of displacement are analyzed by specifying a series of changes in capillary pressure. Different capillary pressure paths result in drastically different relative permeabilities and NAPL recoveries. In ideal circumstances, the ultimate recovery of NAPL can be virtually 100\%, but the recovery time is governed by flow through NAPL layers, which is shown to be very strongly influenced by the boundary condition at the fluid interfaces. The relative permeabilities and capillary pressures we calculate cannot be adequately represented by current empirical models.},

These configurations may contain thick conducting fluid layers, such as oil layers residing between gas in the center and water in the corners of the pore. For pores of uniform, but arbitrary, wettability and in the absence of contact angle hysteresis, a precise thermodynamic criterion for the existence of such layers has been established. In this paper we derive similar criteria for layers in pores of nonuniform wettability, where additional and more complicated layer configurations arise. The criteria for formation and removal of layers are consistent with the capillary entry conditions for the accompanying three-phase bulk displacements, which is essential for accurate pore-scale modeling of three-phase flow. We consider the particular case of three-phase gas invasion in a star-shaped pore with a specific choice of interfacial tensions and contact angles. For this case all possible fluid configurations arise, but only if the water-wet surface in the pore corners is small.},

A constitutive theory is developed resulting in balance equations and thermodynamics appropriate for modelling multiphase flow in porous media. Volume fractions of phases and areal fractions of interfaces are explicitly included in the theory. Incorporation of the interface equations into the theory allows for a complete description of the problem. The manipulations provide explicit functional dependence of the capillary pressure. An extended form of Darcy's law for multiphase flow is obtained from the macroscopic equations of momentum balance. An additional term which accounts for non-uniform fluid saturation at equilibrium appears in the result.},
